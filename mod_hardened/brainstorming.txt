# Future Plans:
- Skip the Defeat-Screen when retiring a run on day 1 (mostly relveant for rolling ironman seeds)
- Use the overworld name-plate tech to display modifiers (hitpoints, armor) during camping? (Look at how Legends implements Text on world map?)
- Hide information about enemy composition on the battle field
	- Might not be realistic because unknown enemies still show up in the turn Order
		- Hiding them in the turnorder might not be 100% perfect. One could estimate by what little tid-bits happen during/after brother turns happen
- certain unholds/high end orcs being able to throw their own allies behind their back in order to advance into tight spaces
- change handgonne aoe pattern in some directions to a triangle
- Rebalance SpiderEgg hunting? Give them Loot?
- perk for civilians (e.g. caravan guys), called "First Aid", making: Injuries you treat during battle are removed instead
- move weapon mastery effects into the weapon mastery itself, instead of being implemented by the skills
- make alps more smart on overworld (stalk player during day)
	- Make it so alps are more aggressive, but they dislike roads. So you are very safe against them while on roads
		- Maybe they dont get a movement bonus anywhere
- prevent allied parties from following you, just because you are being targeted by their allies. Sometimes mercenary companies/nobles think they can/should attack you but you are still allied
- Make raider playstyle more sufficient by giving caravans consistent tool loot
- Maybe remove the replacement of Brawny, Colossus and Fortified Mind on NPCs. Reforged has stepped away from these perks and mods might introduce new secondary effects on them?

- make throwing weapons into hybrid weapon types to profit from axe/spear/flail perks
- make disloyal have more of a downside
- Dynamic Duo You deal 50% less damage to your partner
- Display mood icon during events (Turn that sprite visible / rendertotexture to false/true?)
- Prevent AI from shieldwalling when its the only one left (unless they have rebuke/riposte)
- Add more exclusive groups to various Background
- New AI Behavior for Shield Seargeant (Includes current shield skills and scans for each whether allies profit from it too)
- Add information in Docs that Anatomist and Oathtaker are unsupported
- Prevent cheese where one puts their best bros on the bench in response to a hopeless ambush
- Rework supply-system: If you max out a supply, all remaining ones stay in the inventory instead of being voided
- Shield Skill/attack damage prediction (destruction prediction?)
- AI Logic:
	- Function for calculating the worth of any single entity
		- This already exists in Vanilla, just listing it here because it stay in contrast to the danger
	- Function for calculating the danger of any single entity in isolation
		- This function will look at the targeted entities surrounding to evaluate this
			- e.g. are they an axe wielder near shield users?
			- are they a hammer user next to characters with no armor left?
		- An archer who is in melee is not a huge amount of danger but might still have a lot of "worth" to us, if he is high level or the only enemy arche
- make it so multiple NPC bannerman dont stick together and spread out
- improve visibility during night (overlay night color). Instead the A moon could be visible in the top middle
- Custom Names on enemy Leader and Champions is cool and flavorful, but it gets increasingly confusing as it makes it much harder to identify them correctly. What their base troop is.
	- Maybe there can be a middle ground. Some custom name but also the original name still alongside
	- Maybe a Setting can disable custom names on enemies
- Put Anticipation on some enemies instead of Nimble
- Hitpoint Mults on some injuries -> Injury Threshold Mult / Damage Dealt Mult / get dazed when hit
	- grazed_kidney_injury 60%
	- cut_throat_injury 50%
	- stabbed_guts_injury 40%
	- weakened_heart_injury 30%
- Infrit new skill "Armor as a Weapon": Deal more damage equal to your total remaining armor as a percentage
- expirable potions (so you are forced to use them and so they can be sold/given out more frequently)
- Make it so wait can not be used if you have less than half of your AP remaining?
- Make certain items unsellable
- Scrapper-Retinue member making it so armor damage above a certain threshold (e.g. at least 50 per hit) produces tools fx effect
- Make "Obtain" quests harder. E.g. by starting in an ambush or by making the location hidden by default
- nerf ports (to make good maps less reliable on them)
	- setVirtualTime when using ports (to pass time) - This does not work. VirtualTime has nothing to do with DayCount
- usings just fists (empty throwing weapon) with no offhand should also grant 20% fatigue discount (like from double grip)
- Unwieldy Weapons could lose reach when engage in melee
	- Currently its very weird that its the best play to switch to a pike before ending your turn to maximize reach during opponents turn
- Nested Tooltips for faction/city banner to see relation
- burning damage destroys zombie corpses
	- Needs more research into how corpse removal affects loot
	- This is unlikely to affect corpses that are about to be resurrecte, as those arent marked as "consumable"
- Improve AI by taking into account whether they are already known to the player. And make them prefer steping onto tiles that are already revealed to the player
- Make it so the winner of AI battles also gets all look spawned by the opponents 'getDroppedLoot' function.
	- Or rather whenever a unit dies during an AI battle, the result of that function is pushed into its party Loot
- Docs: Make list of existing functions, that this mod overwrites
- Make three headed flail only hit once during opponents turn (or have it have less chance to hit)
- Display vision of currently active entity, by outlining border of view field on tiles
	- Grey out the tiles not visible to the current entity
- New enemy skill "Gravecall" for ancient undead
- If a Brother dies for sure, a special ghost animation could be played. Maybe something like the Geist death or a spiritual soul leaving the body towards the sky
- new hostility state with factions, where they dont give you contracts but are not yet hostile to you
- New effect given to defender of camps, called "Defender's Advantage". It grants +1 Vision and +10 Resolve. Maybe some other buffs. It reads "You know this place in and out, you have a natural advantage defending it"
- new DayCreated member for locations
	- Can be used to adjust scaling so that newly created locations scale slower than ones already there longer?
	- Can be used for upgrading, so that locations left along can upgrade into stronger versions?
	- Can be used for rumors, where they say: "Recently a new location has appeared there and there"
- Change the campfire story events to always consume a little food but also always provide a random tavern rumor
- remove fatigue-on-hit from most attacks, except specialized weapons (hammer, mace)
- rework of the repair system?
	- remove "repair for profit" system, e.g. by removing the fact that price is calcualted by condition
	- Raise minimum sell price of condition gear to 50%? This would reduce the profit from tool repairs by half
- Make End Turn no longer waste all AP?
	- Make Vigilant explicitely spend all your remaining AP when ending turn
	- Make Command being able to target allies who ended their turns already (if that does not cause too many issues)
- Auto Focus the input boxes during campaign creation. Support Enter/Backspace to move forward and backwards during that screen. Both are a bit tricky because the js code is a huge block
- Display Reputation/Payment changes during payment negotiation
- selling quiver returns their ammo to the player pool?
- highlight destination locations/entities, while the player is moving towards them explicitely
- Make brothers dying in battle more punishing, mood wise (out of combat). To prevent you disposing unwanted brothers this way or discouraging using unwanted brothers as fodder
- Raise fatigue cost of high tier two-handed weapons beyond 15 again
- Clean up Readme section "For Modder": add default values consitently; add new subsubsections "New Events", "General Decisions"
- add small delay after new round, before reanimation begines (100ms) so that new-round effects are more visible
- Give Bog Unhold split shield
- Make Anticipation influence attacker with stuns to be more likely to attack
- Automatically transform stamina-debuffs into fatigue-cost-increase for non-attacks
- Make Schrat headless? Would help with one with the shield. And they dont seem to be decapitatable (check this)
- Make Oathtaker only have 2 armor perks (always Medium)
- Make Caravans have more resources (protection), the more they dont arrive at their destination
- Dislocated Shoulder: Only affect skill cost?
- Give sergeants Fresh&Furious (to help with their command skills)
- Debug Setting, for debugging AI decision made from getQueryTargetMultAsUser and getQueryTargetMultAsTarget functions
- Allow renaming of Dogs (its item name is already serialized, just need the UI)
- Cap the cost of moving over terrain to the maximum Stamina of the character
- make ctrl+mousewheel change the camera levels
- See if fatality chance of vanilla weapons can be raised from 99 to 100, with a few backend tweaks (maybe already possible)
- Autogenerato Wiki Pages as markdown format, from ingame state (weapons, backgrounds, perk groups)
	- Even images can be autogenerated as they can be fetched from ingame, and then moved into the correct position of the wiki repository
- Remove hiring discount from recruiter
- add onGetHit sfx for obstacles and trigger those, when they are hit by an aoe attack or an strayed shot
- melon mugger event causing a downside, when you take him. For example losing some renown
- Play start of turn animations + sfx (e.g. inspiring presence) slightly delayed, while keeping the actual effect instant
- barbarian:
	- 40% chance for roaming parties to have no unholds
	- 20% chance for camps to have no unholds
- Add preview of affected tiles, or tiles that the target would be displaced to on success (the feature that SSU has)
- Do a list of new mechanics
- stackable arena fights?
- remove Brawny again from enemies?
- Show current bros with gladiator necklaces
- Holy Water
	- Increase holy water duration to 5 turns and reduce damage accordingly so that it ends up dealing the same total damage, just slower (nerf)
	- Make it available more common
	- prevent it from randomly spreading
- Hidden ZoC skill for three headed flail that only hits once (to reduce effectiveness in keeping enemies in ZoC)
- Make hook usable on allies
- Make many skills and attacks from within a bush reveal that character to all enemies, not just the immediate target
- Trader Retinue: 10% more movement speed on roads
- Make Ancient Spire enterable repeatidly. But each time you need to choose a brother, who then receives the exhausted debuff for a few days
- After killing enemy with named gear in the arena, offer that piece for sale in the shop (maybe other gear too)
- World Location Icon for when it is a legendary location
- Make **Gash** apply a bleed on the target for each injury on them?
- Make some contracts pay in items instead of gold (part of the reward). And allow player to negotiate that away
- Rework this whole Reforged System of any mastery being able to specialize you in skills, that another mastery would provide.
	- Instead the weapon mastery should be rewritten to only grant effects, that can be applied from within the mastery
- Allow Ironwill potion in the bagslot to be used during battle
- Spawnposition Framework: several properties, that troops can use to define, where they like to be ideally positioned, within a formation
	- e.g. Center, Flank, Front, Back, Farback
- Highlight adjacent opponents, that exert zone of control onto the players tile, whenever a brothers turn starts (option), either forever, or until does does an action
- Brothers that die during sunken library, when you fail/flee the fight, will be part of the enemy roster during the next time (probably needs savegame )
- Make it so that characters who move to a certain tile are already considered to be at the tile during the movement (from the character and tile pov)
- Make sure, Lindwurms only move into tiles, where the tail can follow
- Second Ammunition Slot
- New active skill for **Scout** perk called **Callout**
	- **Callout** costs 4-5 AP and can target any enemy ranged troop
		- That troop deals 20% less ranged damage against yourself and adjacent allies for one turn
	- **Callout** targets 7 tiles
		- You and all adjacent allies take 20% less damage from the targeted enemies
		- You and adjacent allies take 10% more damage from any non-targeted enemies
- API: New virtual getMarkTargets() function for skills,
		- which returns a list of all targets,
		- that should be marked (similar to when you highlight them in the turn sequence bar)
		- while you hover over the tooltip of that effect
	- This can be used for example to show all targets, that you currently have in your **Formidable Approach** list
	- Or for a new **Callout** skill
- New "wake up" skill for all humans, which removes 1 turn of 'stunned' from an adjacent character. Costs 6 AP and 20 fatigue. User must not be engaged in melee
- lightning damage to always hit the head
- make punctured gear more likely to drop in the actual quality left
- parry fx using little stars from ::Const.Tactical.DazeParticles
- Holy Water use case:
	- Destroy undead corpses
- Prevent camps from spawning defenders, while player is nearby
- Prevent camps from joining overworld fights or being attackable while other enemies are nearby

## Wishlist for Reforged
- Moddable Perk Descriptions (Currently you have to overwrite the perk descriptions)
- Improve Weapon Preview (using dummy player) to also respect the removal of those via hooks (as a result currently you have overwrite the onAdded)
- Serialize Perk Groups, so that they will still be found/shown, even if a mod removes or adds one perk to them

## New Content:
	- Make Flesh Cradles destructable (e.g. 100 hp 100 armor). Make them much more attractive to NPCs (anti-dog tech)
	- Make flesh pull cause a negative morale check
	- Make greater flesh golem corpse explosions stronger

## Undead Faction:
- Less resurrection but more resolve checks (e.g. around resurrecting zombie)
	- e.g. resurrection chance = 50%, but them resurrecting causes morale check on adjacent characters?

- Give Ijirok Second Wind and a Unhold Sweep Melee Attack for 4 AP and a Zone of Control Attack
	- Chance its AI to only use the 4 AP after Second Wind for the sweep

## New Perks
- Alchemist
	"A steady hand and the right supplies can mean the difference between life and death."
	"You don’t just fight—you mend, patch, and keep your allies standing."
	- Skills from bag items cost -1 Action Point
	- Once per battle, when you use a bag item on yourself or an adjacent ally, recover 20 Hitpoints on the target

## Perks Review/Rework
- Nailed it
	- Ignore Cover when aiming at a distance of 2
	- Your Shots cannot go astray when aiming at a distance of 3
	- Gain +20% chance to hit the hit when your target is at most 4 tiles away
- Crossbow Mastery
	- Crossbow Mastery making them in your bag always loaded
	- Swap Crossbow with Shield for free once per turn
- Relentless:
	- Using wait or recover does not inflict initiative penalty
	- You can wait an additional time each turn
	- Misses against you while waiting does not build up fatigue
misses dont build up fatigue on you while waiting
- change Rising Star to only gain exp until lvl 12 and grant the two perks always at level 12
These Perks (top = higher prio) im still unhappy with and eventually want to adjust
- Feral Rage
- Trick Shooter
- Hip Shooter
	- Lose 10% Armor Penetration (remove fatigue stuff)
- Mauler
	- replace second effect with 15% more damage when hitting body parts that have no remaining armor
	- You deal 50% more critical damage on a hit to the body
		- 50% seems a big too strong against something like an unhold with decapitate. But then again, thats exactly how much you'd deal on a headshot (unless they had steelbrow)
		- Alternative: Deal +25% critical damage for every injury on the target (no matter which bodypart you target)
- Power Shot
- Take Aim Perk (previously Power Shot)
	- Whenever you wait or end your turn, gain a stacking +5% chance to hit. All bonus is lost, when you attack or move.
	- Unlock **Take Aim** skill, which does the same thing as the mastery thingy stuff

- orc slayer / crusader events, make them cost 5k crowns each to hire those guys
- Schrat can target enemies through objects?
- Give barbarian Madman (icy cave) fast adaptation
- when you press the hotkey of a targetable skill, remove old tooltip and generate new one. This is to replace the generic enemy tooltip with one showing hitchance
- Improve sell margin of food to make trading with those more interesting

## Enemies
- Reduce Defense of Assassins, make it so they rely only on Dodge

## AI
- Make AI less likely to use shieldwall while in a net
- make unholds value highground less
- New Strategy of individual enemies, called "Stalling":
	- They prefer defensive over offensive actions and try to stay alive as long as possible
- Write AP prediction for new sanguinary effect for player and enemies (could be done by simulating a 3 AP discount on all 1-range skills targetting a certain enemy)
- Utilize existing hiding-ai-behavior to improve some enemies (e.g. direwolves, ghouls or fast bandits)
- Make AI use Roundswing less often
- Fleeing enemies engaged in melee at the map border do not seek out the border. Instead they flee alongside it
- Player: Make fleeing player characters actually leave the battle when at the border
- Unholds should use throw more often to counter rebuke/flailing swingy stuff
- Make it so enemies are less likely to remove the net if it doesnt affect them (e.g. Orcs)
- Change AI Rotation to not/rarely rotate your brothers into battle?
- Make enemy archers prefer to use wait instead of blindly advancing, if their frontline hasn't advanced yet
	- Make make enemy archers prefer wait during the first turn in general, if they have no target?
- Make root skills much more likely to target someone with Unstoppable stacks (because they cancel unstoppable)
- Lower the urge for nachzehrers to kill themselves to ZOC just to seek out a corpse
- Make someone with **Crowded** less likely to be targeted by displacement skills (knock back/repel). That would only help those
- If thrower uses last throwing weapon, mak them switch to melee weapon immediately
- make NPCs with Formidable Approach more likely to move to tiles with adjacent enemies which they dont yet have in their list or which are confident with less max HP

## Fix:
- Currently Swing and Hit sfx happen at the same time, which is unrealistic
	- Make hit sfx come with a slight (e.g. 100ms) delay instead
	- Problem: Vanilla allows a delay for hit sounds, but the receiving entity moan sounds have no adjustable delay
- Enemies that gain shieldwall from shield sergeant while not visible to the player, wont lose the shieldwall animation, until some ui update happens on them (e.g. getting attacked)
	- Can be reproduced by fighting nomads with a leader. No Idea, how exactly that is caused
- Add a hitchance tooltip line for the native 25% hitchance bonus that knock back has in vanilla
- prevent cheese where you can find out whether someone is hiding in a bush by trying to pathfind into that bush
	- same thing is true for fog of war
- footprints of barbarian kings dont seem to produce tooltip for lookout
- keep track of non-spawning ifrits and the loot potentially lost by those an attach it to the remaining one
- Sometimes on the World map, a single mouse wheel roll zooms the camera completely. Probably has to do with some timer running too far
- dog ai too fast, not realizing reanimating zombies and dying to ZOC hits
- Make Rotate no longer cause resolve checks
- Fix orcs sometimes using charge, even though they decided to give up
- Alps that teleport during first turn before revealing, might be shown as unknown, even though you can see them because they arrived on visible tiles
- Look into Recover being blocked by worn down, but still showing as active, when previewing another skill
- debug zombies
	- No Idea, I ran out of ideas following the lead of updateVisibility calls. I assumed that Zombies pushing other zombies, after my turn starts, messes something up. But that didnt do it
	- found kinda a potential solution, see discord
- Make Mercenaries, that you help in fights, sometimes giving you one of their painted shield as a thank-you to remember them by

## Rework Training Hall
- Once per battle if you start your turn fleeing and not adjacent to an enemy, recover your morale to steady
- Attacks cost +1 AP and have +15% chance to hit

## For Reforged
- Anonymous Damage Sources (bleed, fire, poison), count as if the target dealt damage to themselves regarding the experience-sharing
	-> Those anonymous damage sources steal experience from the player, even if the player applied them
	- Count anonymous damage sources (when someone deals damage to themselves) as a new faction (Faction.None)

## Backlog
- Reduce bleeding noise
	- Cant fix right now, because 'refresh' only supports increased stacks by 1. Reforged suffers the same problem when inflicting 3 bleed via Gouge for example

- split hyena/nachzehrer troops

# WIP

- Black Monolith only during night

## For modder:
- Framework for tracking round number of a skill for an entity https://github.com/MSUTeam/MSU/issues/351
- New world_state function called "hourly update", which is called once per hour (just like the update from asset manager)
	- However this is also called, whenever certain notable actions happen. For example, when the player teleports around/uses the port, or onCombatFinished (fastTravelTo)
		- Actually updateTopbarAssets is really convenient in that regard
- improve orc berserker AI to use stun charge too
	- their weird choice of setting EngageTargetMultipleOpponentsMult = -1.0,
		- makes it so the resulting ScoreMult is negative with odd numbers of ZoC enemies and positive with equal numbers
		- will add tilescores (which isnt even too bad). While a positive value there would remove tilescore
	- ai_charge is mainly handled via `ai_engage_melee`
	- in a simple 1v1 test the berserk uses his charge just fine
	-> maybe a total rewrite of ai_engage_melee is in order

### Fix
- local r = this.Math.rand(100, 200) * 0.01; in send_supplies_action gets overwritten later on, causing weird rewards
- Play other animations also slightly staggered (e.g. fleeing animation) to counter act the lag a bit
- add debug logs for finding the end of battle bug
- repel push angle. Streamer pushed an diagonal enemy 80° to the left

### Feature
- Contracts which change morale/renown/relation but are not yet covered, display those in the next screen
- add system where equipped loot is only decided upon once, whether it drops. So if a dead character reanimates and dies again you dont have more chances to loot that gear
- First Aid (enemy-only for now)
	"A steady hand and the right supplies can mean the difference between life and death."
	"You don’t just fight—you mend, patch, and keep your allies standing."
	- Skills from bag items cost -1 Action Point
	- Once per battle, when you use a bag item on yourself or an adjacent ally, recover 20 Hitpoints on the target

### Misc
- User-Faced Changelog (actual changes)
- Modder Faced one (migrating mods)

## MV
- Tests (logs printing) whether ai multiplier for skills are even working


- shieldwall animation bug at the start of the combat

- look into the debug log vanilla recently removed from skill container printing. Maybe i dont need to skip that anymore in hardened


- Make it so ranged troop AI is less likely to be dumb (leave perfectly fine positions)
	- Often times ranged troops go before their melee army.
		- In this case they should actively wait, realising that they first need to see how their melee troops behave
		- Alternatively they should move only very slightly forward and/or only into cover

from Modular Vanilla

- rework dropchance of items to make daggering later in the game more worth for farming money
	- Make it more likely to drop while at full condition
	- make it less likely to drop while at lower condition
	- Make items drop much closer to the condition that they had

- API: hook onQueryTargetTile to implement new ai function

- Make Infected Wound not heal, while no medical supplies are left
- Make Infected Wound stop healing of all present untreated injuries, until medical supplies are there

- Tooltip for economic difficulty changes
- color adjacent enemies, that exert ZOC onto you in a color, when previewing movement out of ZOC

- Make world parties that are left with 1 troop after auto-battle disappear. Otherwise you get parties with a single necromancer or hexen or barbarian king

- turn order predictions for next round

- AI: more likely to push back kingfisher guys who are currently netting someone, if the push back tile would break the net
- Remove whirling stance when stunned

- Add Retribution to Tough Bandits (up from Pillager). Remove Survival Instinct from all low tier thug bandits
	- Maybe add Resilint to all Tough Bandits?

- sfx when the target of kingfisher dies (as if you reel in the net)
- kingfisher gets dazed, when target frees itself from net
- split shield does not update the shield correctly
- ghost fights might have to do with alliances not being created correctly. Maybe the new southern settlements interfere with the placement for hard-coded alliances


## Camp Rework
- Camping requires 1-2 hours to set up
- Effect:
	- Protects you against ambushes
	- Makes you immune to being attacked by Alps
	- More repair specialized
	- More Hitpoint Recovery (even more than Vanilla)
- Requires 1-2 hours to de-construct and move on

- Utilize this way of verifying the caller, from Reforged:
::TacticalNavigator.teleport <- function( _user, _targetTile, _func, _data, _bool, _float = 1.0 )
{
	local caller = ::getstackinfos(2).locals["this"];
	if (!::isKindOf(caller, "skill") || !(caller in ::Reforged.ScheduleSkills))
	{
		teleport(_user, _targetTile, _func, _data, _bool, _float);
		return;
	}


Look into Reforged latest changes around footmen getting Exploit Opening
- Remove Vigorous Assault from Pillagers?
- Outlaws no longer need vig ass now that they get it in reforged?

- make spider corpses a bit more transparent, less colored, so that they differ more from alive ones
- make surgeon also unlock from using bandages

- Make enemies blocked by 2 tiles twice as likely to divert attacks
- Make necromancer able to retreat

- Only use Paint and spawn sfx, if the Variant of the affected item is different, after calling onPaint on it

- Improve Readme by writing out price changes to shields and weight changes to quivers
