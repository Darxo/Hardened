# Future Plans:
- Skip the Defeat-Screen when retiring a run on day 1 (mostly relveant for rolling ironman seeds)
- Use the overworld name-plate tech to display modifiers (hitpoints, armor) during camping? (Look at how Legends implements Text on world map?)
- Hide information about enemy composition on the battle field
	- Might not be realistic because unknown enemies still show up in the turn Order
		- Hiding them in the turnorder might not be 100% perfect. One could estimate by what little tid-bits happen during/after brother turns happen
- certain unholds/high end orcs being able to throw their own allies behind their back in order to advance into tight spaces
- change handgonne aoe pattern in some directions to a triangle
- Rebalance SpiderEgg hunting? Give them Loot?
- perk for civilians (e.g. caravan guys), called "First Aid", making: Injuries you treat during battle are removed instead
- move weapon mastery effects into the weapon mastery itself, instead of being implemented by the skills
- make alps more smart on overworld (stalk player during day)
	- Make it so alps are more aggressive, but they dislike roads. So you are very safe against them while on roads
		- Maybe they dont get a movement bonus anywhere
- prevent allied parties from following you, just because you are being targeted by their allies. Sometimes mercenary companies/nobles think they can/should attack you but you are still allied
- Make raider playstyle more sufficient by giving caravans consistent tool loot
- Maybe remove the replacement of Brawny, Colossus and Fortified Mind on NPCs. Reforged has stepped away from these perks and mods might introduce new secondary effects on them?

- make throwing weapons into hybrid weapon types to profit from axe/spear/flail perks
- make disloyal have more of a downside
- Display mood icon during events (Turn that sprite visible / rendertotexture to false/true?)
- Prevent AI from shieldwalling when its the only one left (unless they have rebuke/riposte)
- Add more exclusive groups to various Background
- New AI Behavior for Shield Seargeant (Includes current shield skills and scans for each whether allies profit from it too)
- Add information in Docs that Anatomist and Oathtaker are unsupported
- Prevent cheese where one puts their best bros on the bench in response to a hopeless ambush
- Rework supply-system: If you max out a supply, all remaining ones stay in the inventory instead of being voided
- Shield Skill/attack damage prediction (destruction prediction?)
	- Function for calculating the worth of any single entity
- AI Logic:
		- This already exists in Vanilla, just listing it here because it stay in contrast to the danger
	- Function for calculating the danger of any single entity in isolation
		- This function will look at the targeted entities surrounding to evaluate this
			- e.g. are they an axe wielder near shield users?
			- are they a hammer user next to characters with no armor left?
		- An archer who is in melee is not a huge amount of danger but might still have a lot of "worth" to us, if he is high level or the only enemy arche
- make it so multiple NPC bannerman dont stick together and spread out
- improve visibility during night (overlay night color). Instead the A moon could be visible in the top middle
- Custom Names on enemy Leader and Champions is cool and flavorful, but it gets increasingly confusing as it makes it much harder to identify them correctly. What their base troop is.
	- Maybe there can be a middle ground. Some custom name but also the original name still alongside
	- Maybe a Setting can disable custom names on enemies
- Put Anticipation on some enemies instead of Nimble
- Hitpoint Mults on some injuries -> Injury Threshold Mult / Damage Dealt Mult / get dazed when hit
	- grazed_kidney_injury 60%
	- cut_throat_injury 50%
	- stabbed_guts_injury 40%
	- weakened_heart_injury 30%
- Infrit new skill "Armor as a Weapon": Deal more damage equal to your total remaining armor as a percentage
- expirable potions (so you are forced to use them and so they can be sold/given out more frequently)
- Scrapper-Retinue member making it so armor damage above a certain threshold (e.g. at least 50 per hit) produces tools fx effect
- Make "Obtain" quests harder. E.g. by starting in an ambush or by making the location hidden by default
- nerf ports (to make good maps less reliable on them)
	- setVirtualTime when using ports (to pass time) - This does not work. VirtualTime has nothing to do with DayCount
- usings just fists (empty throwing weapon) with no offhand should also grant 20% fatigue discount (like from double grip)
- Unwieldy Weapons could lose reach when engage in melee
	- Currently its very weird that its the best play to switch to a pike before ending your turn to maximize reach during opponents turn
- Nested Tooltips for faction/city banner to see relation
- burning damage destroys zombie corpses
	- Needs more research into how corpse removal affects loot
	- This is unlikely to affect corpses that are about to be resurrecte, as those arent marked as "consumable"
- Improve AI by taking into account whether they are already known to the player. And make them prefer steping onto tiles that are already revealed to the player
- Make it so the winner of AI battles also gets all look spawned by the opponents 'getDroppedLoot' function.
	- Or rather whenever a unit dies during an AI battle, the result of that function is pushed into its party Loot
- Docs: Make list of existing functions, that this mod overwrites
- Make three headed flail only hit once during opponents turn (or have it have less chance to hit)
- Display vision of currently active entity, by outlining border of view field on tiles
	- Grey out the tiles not visible to the current entity
- New enemy skill "Gravecall" for ancient undead
- new hostility state with factions, where they dont give you contracts but are not yet hostile to you
- New effect given to defender of camps, called "Defender's Advantage". It grants +1 Vision and +10 Resolve. Maybe some other buffs. It reads "You know this place in and out, you have a natural advantage defending it"
- new DayCreated member for locations
	- Can be used to adjust scaling so that newly created locations scale slower than ones already there longer?
	- Can be used for upgrading, so that locations left along can upgrade into stronger versions?
	- Can be used for rumors, where they say: "Recently a new location has appeared there and there"
- Change the campfire story events to always consume a little food but also always provide a random tavern rumor
- remove fatigue-on-hit from most attacks, except specialized weapons (hammer, mace)
- rework of the repair system?
	- remove "repair for profit" system, e.g. by removing the fact that price is calcualted by condition
	- Raise minimum sell price of condition gear to 50%? This would reduce the profit from tool repairs by half
- Make End Turn no longer waste all AP?
	- Make Vigilant explicitely spend all your remaining AP when ending turn
	- Make Command being able to target allies who ended their turns already (if that does not cause too many issues)
- Auto Focus the input boxes during campaign creation. Support Enter/Backspace to move forward and backwards during that screen. Both are a bit tricky because the js code is a huge block
- selling quiver returns their ammo to the player pool?
- Make brothers dying in battle more punishing, mood wise (out of combat). To prevent you disposing unwanted brothers this way or discouraging using unwanted brothers as fodder
- Raise fatigue cost of high tier two-handed weapons beyond 15 again
- Clean up Readme section "For Modder": add default values consitently; add new subsubsections "New Events", "General Decisions"
- add small delay after new round, before reanimation begines (100ms) so that new-round effects are more visible
- Make Anticipation influence attacker with stuns to be more likely to attack
- Automatically transform stamina-debuffs into fatigue-cost-increase for non-attacks
- Make Schrat headless? Would help with one with the shield. And they dont seem to be decapitatable (check this)
- Make Oathtaker only have 2 armor perks (always Medium)
- Make Caravans have more resources (protection), the more they dont arrive at their destination
- Debug Setting, for debugging AI decision made from getQueryTargetMultAsUser and getQueryTargetMultAsTarget functions
- Allow renaming of Dogs (its item name is already serialized, just need the UI)
- Cap the cost of moving over terrain to the maximum Stamina of the character
- make ctrl+mousewheel change the camera levels
- See if fatality chance of vanilla weapons can be raised from 99 to 100, with a few backend tweaks (maybe already possible)
- Autogenerate Wiki Pages as markdown format, from ingame state (weapons, backgrounds, perk groups)
	- Even images can be autogenerated as they can be fetched from ingame, and then moved into the correct position of the wiki repository
- add onGetHit sfx for obstacles and trigger those, when they are hit by an aoe attack or an strayed shot
- melon mugger event causing a downside, when you take him. For example losing some renown
- Play start of turn animations + sfx (e.g. inspiring presence) slightly delayed, while keeping the actual effect instant
- Add preview of affected tiles, or tiles that the target would be displaced to on success (the feature that SSU has)
- Do a list of new mechanics
- Holy Water
	- Increase holy water duration to 5 turns and reduce damage accordingly so that it ends up dealing the same total damage, just slower (nerf)
	- Make it available more common
	- prevent it from randomly spreading
- Hidden ZoC skill for three headed flail that only hits once (to reduce effectiveness in keeping enemies in ZoC)
- Trader Retinue: 10% more movement speed on roads
- Make Ancient Spire enterable repeatidly. But each time you need to choose a brother, who then receives the exhausted debuff for a few days
- After killing enemy with named gear in the arena, offer that piece for sale in the shop (maybe other gear too)
- World Location Icon for when it is a legendary location
- Make some contracts pay in items instead of gold (part of the reward). And allow player to negotiate that away
- Rework this whole Reforged System of any mastery being able to specialize you in skills, that another mastery would provide.
	- Instead the weapon mastery should be rewritten to only grant effects, that can be applied from within the mastery
- Allow Ironwill potion in the bagslot to be used during battle
- Spawnposition Framework: several properties, that troops can use to define, where they like to be ideally positioned, within a formation
	- e.g. Center, Flank, Front, Back, Farback
- Highlight adjacent opponents, that exert zone of control onto the players tile, whenever a brothers turn starts (option), either forever, or until does does an action
- Brothers that die during sunken library, when you fail/flee the fight, will be part of the enemy roster during the next time (probably needs savegame )
- Make it so that characters who move to a certain tile are already considered to be at the tile during the movement (from the character and tile pov).
	- Their getTile should return the destination tile and their isPlacedOnMap should return true
- Second Ammunition Slot
- API: New virtual getMarkTargets() function for skills,
		- which returns a list of all targets,
		- that should be marked (similar to when you highlight them in the turn sequence bar)
		- while you hover over the tooltip of that effect
	- This can be used for example to show all targets, that you currently have in your **Formidable Approach** list
	- Or for a new **Callout** skill
- New "wake up" skill for all humans, which removes 1 turn of 'stunned' from an adjacent character. Costs 6 AP and 20 fatigue. User must not be engaged in melee
- lightning damage to always hit the head
- make punctured gear more likely to drop in the actual quality left
- Holy Water use case:
	- Destroy undead corpses
- Prevent camps from joining overworld fights or being attackable while other enemies are nearby

## Wishlist for Reforged
- Moddable Perk Descriptions (Currently you have to overwrite the perk descriptions)
- Improve Weapon Preview (using dummy player) to also respect the removal of those via hooks (as a result currently you have overwrite the onAdded)
- Serialize Perk Groups, so that they will still be found/shown, even if a mod removes or adds one perk to them

## New Content:
	- Make Flesh Cradles destructable (e.g. 100 hp 100 armor). Make them much more attractive to NPCs (anti-dog tech)
	- Make flesh pull cause a negative morale check
	- Make greater flesh golem corpse explosions stronger

- Give Ijirok Second Wind and a Unhold Sweep Melee Attack for 4 AP and a Zone of Control Attack
	- Chance its AI to only use the 4 AP after Second Wind for the sweep

## New Effects

	- V1 Trigger two positive Morale Checks whenever you use Recover
	- V2 When you use Recover, trigger a positive Morale Check and gain **Meditating**
		- **Meditating**
			- +20 Resolve until the start of your next Turn

### For Reforged
- Anonymous Damage Sources (bleed, fire, poison), count as if the target dealt damage to themselves regarding the experience-sharing
	-> Those anonymous damage sources steal experience from the player, even if the player applied them
	- Count anonymous damage sources (when someone deals damage to themselves) as a new faction (Faction.None)
### Line of Sight fix
- Dont show tile blocking square for tiles that are completely hidden by terrain (because of camera height)
### Poise System
- utilize modular vanilla Ai score framework to make AI more capable of predicting stun outcomes
- poise system log for stun breakdown: "Foo dealt X Poise Damage to Baz (Y) [, causing a Z turn stun]



{	// Animation
	- animation for when bone plating breaks. Like parry but much rougher bigger and granular material flying away
	- reduce particle amount on tile particles while the cursor is near?
	- impact animation for handgonne on all affected tiles (slight sweeping fire particle animation)
	- animate fireplace object
	- rabies saliva effect on frenzied direwolf/hyenas
	- smoke bomb on snow is hard to spot
	- parry fx that spawns towards north, might need to be rendered behind the parry guy (e.g. for the tile on top of him instead of his tile)
	- turn any corpse that is not reanimating and that cant be reanimated (beats or headless corpses) into a pale/grey/low saturation tone, to make it stand further apart from alive ones
	- trigger smoke effect whenever a brother with **Ghostlike** dodges an attack during their turn
	- mortar impact animation, when shockwave or full force trigger
	- projectile for throw net
	- effect when character withstands mental moral check (purple particles flying away from head + head blinking white?)
}

{	// AI
	- Make rooted characters les likely to use riposte
	- Make AI less likely to use shieldwall while in a net
	- make unholds value highground less
	- New Strategy of individual enemies, called "Stalling":
		- They prefer defensive over offensive actions and try to stay alive as long as possible
	- Utilize existing hiding-ai-behavior to improve some enemies (e.g. direwolves, ghouls or fast bandits)
	- Make AI use Roundswing less often
	- Fleeing enemies engaged in melee at the map border do not seek out the border. Instead they flee alongside it
	- Unholds should use throw more often to counter rebuke/flailing swingy stuff
	- Change AI Rotation to not/rarely rotate your brothers into battle?
	- Make enemy archers prefer to use wait instead of blindly advancing, if their frontline hasn't advanced yet
		- Make make enemy archers prefer wait during the first turn in general, if they have no target?
	- Lower the urge for nachzehrers to kill themselves to ZOC just to seek out a corpse
	- Make someone with **Crowded** less likely to be targeted by displacement skills (knock back/repel). That would only help those
	- If thrower uses last throwing weapon, mak them switch to melee weapon immediately
	- make NPCs with Formidable Approach more likely to move to tiles with adjacent enemies which they dont yet have in their list or which are confident with less max HP
	- Fix orcs sometimes using charge, even though they decided to give up
	- Tests (logs printing) whether ai multiplier for skills are even working
	- make killing frenzy/berserk AI prefer targets that they can one-shot/kill
	- Make many skills and attacks from within a bush reveal that character to all enemies, not just the immediate target
	- Make root skills much more likely to target someone with Unstoppable stacks (because they cancel unstoppable)
	- make formidable approach characters more likely to be targeted by rotation-like skills if that puts them next to new enemies or removes confident from enemies potentially
	- change escorting so that the escorting character adds its strength and numbers to the army it is escorting
		- not very useful, while this only affects the player and what he is escorting. Once non-player parties can form groups, it will be useful
	- make footwork rarely be used on the tile that the actor started its turn on (otherwise it too often results in weird dancing/decisions by goblins)
	- build upon reforged squire mentor ai system to glue certain NPCs together much more consistently (e.g. mortar + engineer)
}

{	// Artwork
	- improve bola skill contrast
	- make a green variant of the damage_received.png to use for poison immunity tooltips or effects around poisons
	- make the round circle during combat have a background of day/night depending on the daytime
	- increase visual size of feral shield
	- make spider corpses a bit more transparent, less colored, so that they differ more from alive ones
		- or make alive ones in a more vibrant color
	- give bag slot weapons a offset to the top left so simulate depth and make them more visible with attachements on
		- maybe increase their size slightly too?
		- this does not work outside of combat
	- T1 "Polemace": A long combat stick that doubles as a walking cane
	- Malnourished icon
	- different bleed icons depending on severity of bleed
	- make feral shields bigger in size
	- "unknown-faction" flag (literally) for locations, who don't show their defender, or where different factions could be inside
}

{	// Balance
	- swap rebuke with one with the shield
	- Look into Recover being blocked by worn down, but still showing as active, when previewing another skill
	- net price in southern non-coast cities
}

{	// Documentation
	- User-Faced Changelog (actual changes)
	- Modder Faced one (migrating mods)
	- Improve Readme by writing out price changes to shields and weight changes to quivers
}

{	// Fix
	- fix(vanilla): a ranged miss with a coat poison effect deducting two charges instead of one (if we miss the main target and the astray target)
	- vanilla fix: auto looted items being lost when loading iron man saves
	- events might not trigger correctly in hardened
		- they might be delayed by the force trigger of the retinue slot event
	- investigate: how did money check timing change?
	- increase contract/location resources considering reforged soon bug fix about 70-100% resources
	- Sometimes after battle, when shooting and reloading all crossbow,s the crossbows are unloaded, but shortly after loaded again (by vanilla??)
	- whirling stance is still not correctly removed when stunned. Perhaps it needs to be done in "onOtherSkillAdded"
	- fix savescumming of tavern rumors; they reset each time you reload and visit the tavern again
	- improve the burn-away-roots logic by iterating over all skills on the target, simulating an onUpdate for each of them to find out which one turns on "IsRooted"
	- overwhelm seems to not take visual effect, when stack is added. only after another update is triggered on the target
	- adrenaline causes you to recover hitpoitns and fatigue, when it disables injuries which reduced those values (e.g. chest cut)
	- Fix corpse armor offset being too low (neck and hand are only halfway visible)
	- vanilla bug: decapitate max armor pen damage not multiplied by *2
	- while its not an allies turn, they regularly have +1 max AP. might be connected with waiting
	- Currently Swing and Hit sfx happen at the same time, which is unrealistic
		- Make hit sfx come with a slight (e.g. 100ms) delay instead
		- Problem: Vanilla allows a delay for hit sounds, but the receiving entity moan sounds have no adjustable delay
	- keep track of non-spawning ifrits and the loot potentially lost by those an attach it to the remaining one
	- dog ai too fast, not realizing reanimating zombies and dying to ZOC hits (I have a possible solution as PR)
	- Make Rotate no longer cause resolve checks
	- debug zombies
		- No Idea, I ran out of ideas following the lead of updateVisibility calls. I assumed that Zombies pushing other zombies, after my turn starts, messes something up. But that didnt do it
			- found kinda a potential solution, see discord
	- world NPC combat ghost bug battlesite:
		- This is probably caused by them engaging with themselves or an ally in combat
			-> they never kill anyone in that combat because there are no real enemies
			-> combat does not progress immediately
		- This might happen, if their allies, or themselves get pushed into their "KnownOpponents" list, from which they then fetch targets to attack
			- Perhaps, they get shared wrong information?
		- fix ghost fights: might have to do with alliances not being created correctly. Maybe the new southern settlements interfere with the placement for hard-coded alliances
		- could this have to do with me stunning world parties after spawning?
		- We deployed two fixes for this: a party will no attack itself; a party will not join a fight, that itself is already a part of
		- This probably has to do with the combat manager having its Faction array hard-stuck at a max of 32. While in Vanilla up to 31 Factions can already appear
			- Any mod, which adds more factions, can probably trigger this issue
			- However, in Slurgis Hardened run, he didnt use any faction mods and still got the ghost fights
	- (Vanilla): Split has 30% armor penetration even though every weapon who grants it in vanilla has less pen
	- local r = this.Math.rand(100, 200) * 0.01; in send_supplies_action gets overwritten later on, causing weird rewards
	- fix/prevent cheese where you can find out whether someone is hiding in a bush by trying to pathfind into that bush
		- same thing is true for fog of war
	- add debug logs for finding the end of battle bug
	- broken shield glitch (outside of combat the paperdoll shield looks healthy while the shield brush is damaged). all whn the shield is damaged
	- probably just make it not look broken outside of battle (or maybe that is already the case and what is missing is just an update?)
	- fix(vanilla) parties on world map that concluded fights, still counting as on-going battles. You still spawn at the corner of the battle shortly after
	- linebreaker (from onslaught) is not a once-per-turn (happens twice during snowman stream)
	- when buying supplies, play animation for the supply values
	- fix world zooming when entering/leaving main menu
	- fix camp fights situations, where a random tree fills the main entrance
	- day time tooltip on world map barely displaying. The javascript parts there (WorldScreenTopbarDayTimeModule) is horribly at producing it
	- fix some towns spawning with ports which are not visible: You can still travel to them, but not from them
		- caused by ports being force-built in fishing towns
		- but fishing towns are not guaranteed to be considered "IsCoastal"
	- fix description of swordmaster perks (consussive strikes e.g.)
	- make sure fresh and furious enemies use the free attack despite being at 0 AP
	- weapon master requirement is not accurate, it should be moved to the bullet point where it is needed
	- bug: projectiles dont seem to be renders all too often (reason is likely the high speed with swifter)
	- fix(vanilla) medium_snow_fort attached locations not being placable on snow
	- remove trade goods from shop when leaving town (fixes trade ambition exploit)
	- Remove color-code from item descriptions when they are fetched by the taxidermist (those codes cant be displayed there)
}

{	// New Content
	- Rework Training Hall
		- Once per battle if you start your turn fleeing and not adjacent to an enemy, recover your morale to steady
		- Attacks cost +1 AP and have +15% chance to hit
	- new type of caravan that transports only gold (because they came back from selling or are about to buy stuff)
		- they look the same as normal caravans except that they move significant faster (like 80% instead of 50%)
	- Make contracts aligned with either positive or negative morale reputation
		- rebuild/caravan/envoy/packet/great battle are positive aligned (they trust you with something)
		- find thiefs/destroy location are negative aligned (this mission is potentially dangerous, just for you)
		- not aligned: find location, defend against raiding parties
	- rumors around position of nearby mercenary companies on the world map
	- rumors around nearby undiscovered locations
	- new item: torch
		- Offhand Item
		- Grant +3 Vision
		- Can be thrown on an empty tile to illuminate the area around it in a radius of 5 tiles
	- Event: dealer of stolen goods sells faction armor
		- You are offered to buy some armor of a faction whose town you are in, for cheap
		- The armor in question is Mail Hauberk (170 / 19)
		- If you accept, you potentially lose some relation to that faction (someone saw you do the deal)
		- Alternatively a background (peddler) can make it cheaper or thief can make it less likely top raise suspicion
	- Horse Fucker Event: give him a body (back) injury he sustained from the whipping
		- Make you lose 10 Renown when accepting the guy (you go "against the law")
}

{	// Sound
	- custom sound effect for whirling stance (lower pitch and repeating)
	- sfx when the target of kingfisher dies (as if you reel in the net)
	- Howler Monkey sfx for some kind of beast
	- special sfx when discovering a legendary location
	- sfx when bone breaker causes an injury
	- write a custom BB sound engine, by playing sound at the same time in right and left ear but with tiny delay to simulate depth/direction
	- increase movement fatigue cost in order to make moving more tactical
	- cover ally making ally immune to displacement?
	- make schrat damage sounds, whenever arrows divert into trees.
		- or rather allow obstacles to have a hit-sfx, which is played when they get hit by a projectile
	- play multiple flail sfx, for each three headed hit
	- make ifirts not play sounds when growing (sand_golem::grow)
	- Any actor moving will produce step-sounds, even if not visible to player. But then with lower volume: "_tile.IsVisibleForPlayer ? 1.0 : 0.5"
}

{	// Design
	- Orcs with white unhold fur (maybe for champions?)
		- Why do attachments on orcs not visually appear? Their effects work just fine. Maybe a Z value during metadata.xml?
	- make nomad leader not spawn with javelins anymore
	- sell bandages in alchemists
	- increase weight of oathtaker helm by 1 and give it +5 resolve
	- ijirok perk something like "hardening on impact"
		- Whenever you take damage, gain a stacking 5% less damage taken until the start of your next turn
	- make all throwing perks apply to throwing tools
	- make goblin bows pen to 50% (like the named version has as a base value)
		- maybe reduce its damage in response
	- make parry not work against any flail attacks?
	- change quartermaster to make consumable supplies more likely to be sold by towns
	- **Disarm** (whips): "You have -1% Hitchance per Weight on the weapon you are targeting"
	- increase lindwurm acid droprate
	- add oathbringer as possible elite spawns in mercenary companies
	- scale resources and rewards of "Supply Caravan"
		- currently they have hardcoded resources equal to local r = this.Math.rand(100, 200) * 0.01;
	- make dropchance of gear (e.g. shields) depending on their relative condition
	- swap formidable approach with death dealer?
		- that way it is on par with Duelist and makes the level 7 skill choice ever so more competetive
	- lookout cost to 2000? (from 2500)
	- additional champion chance for every 1000 renown?
	- any brothers that dies during combat causes you to lose renown
		- either flat 100
		- or 50 + 10 per level
		- or 20 * level
	- buff burned hand injury (0.5 threshold) closer to split hand injuries; afterall the 0.25 burned face injury is worse
	- buff obsidian dagger
	- should trader origin really get reduced renown? Might make game not challenging at all
	- nerf deathblow armor pen or damage, as (unlike vanilla) it is easier to enable its condition
	- nerf the padded skull cap because it looks bad?
	- make master archer/swordmaster appear slightly later as to not appear in too weak of a camp?
	- make negative stat multipliers no longer affect characters who have negative stats?
	- reduce minimum vision to 1 (like in vanilla), but allow all attacks to target enemies at 2 tiles, even if you dont see them (but you revealed them this turn)
	- orc berserk flanking from EngageFlankingMult 1.5 --> 1.25?
	- increase geist scream penalty? Afterall they were nerfed by the morale nerf
	- make lower star contracts grant less renown and higher ones grant more renown (instead of all 3 tiers the same amount)
	- make infected wound prevent other wounds from healing
	- make throw pots count as throwables? And make oppotunist work with them?
	- trigger tavern rumor again if it provides the exact same text as the previous one
	- change scout to also give a soft pathfinder effect?
	- make wear them down respect the targets fatigue build up multiplier
	- slightly increase cost of crossbows? they are effectively stronger than in vanilla
	- add supporter to caravan hands
	- reduce weapon perk groups of gambler to 2 (down from 3)
	- slighty increase available recruits in the nearest town on a new playthrough
	- lower goblin xp and implement their money worth?
	- change holy water
		- to not spread
		- make it craftable
		- replace third holy water reward in ancient temple with a +1 Perk Point Jug
	- increase cost of hexen skills so they cant use both at the same time
	- make "wear them down" increase cost of non-attacks by 50% instead of disabling recover
	- improve axe hammer damage
	- move underdog to T3?
	- allow alps to free from nets, but keep their mskill at 0
	- barb beastmaster more melee skill
	- make all characters (not just with melee weapons/fists) trigger a morale check when approaching enemies
	- reloadable firelance

	- Implement safe way of adding entity types mid-save (crock pot)

{	// Wiki
	# Survival Guide

	These are noticable changes by Hardened, that might catch you off-guard
	- First read the cheese-section on the wiki, so you know what does not work anymore

	## Noticable Differences coming from Vanilla

	- Nets dont reduce Initiative

	- Some enemies can't be disarmed (Orc Warlord, Barbarian King, Hedge Knight, Grand Diviner)
	- Some weapons have their AP cost reduced: The main attack from **2H Wooden Hammer**, **2H Wooden Flail** and **Goedendag** cost 5 AP (from 6 AP)
	- 2+ tile melee attacks get hitchance penalties for every adjacent enemy
	- add renown penalty when entering fight with temporary enemies (= you practically backstab someone who trusted you)
	- Your faction (+dogs) must have done the most damage on an enemy in order to get their loost. Kill stealing for loot no longer works

	## Noticable Differences coming from Reforged/Vanilla

	- Nets dont reduce Initiative
	- Some enemies can't be disarmed (Orc Warlord, Barbarian King, Hedge Knight, Grand Diviner)
	- You can't puncture someone unless 2+ characters are surrounding them (maybe)

	- Some weapons have their AP cost reduced: **Stab** costs 3 AP (from 4 AP) on all daggers
	- Some weapons have their AP cost increased: All Poleflail attacks cost 6 AP (up from 5 AP)

- balance the crock pot hooded man accordingly
