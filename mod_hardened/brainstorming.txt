# Future Plans:
- Skip the Defeat-Screen when retiring a run on day 1 (mostly relveant for rolling ironman seeds)
- Use the overworld name-plate tech to display modifiers (hitpoints, armor) during camping? (Look at how Legends implements Text on world map?)
- Hide information about enemy composition on the battle field
	- Might not be realistic because unknown enemies still show up in the turn Order
		- Hiding them in the turnorder might not be 100% perfect. One could estimate by what little tid-bits happen during/after brother turns happen
- certain unholds/high end orcs being able to throw their own allies behind their back in order to advance into tight spaces
- change handgonne aoe pattern in some directions to a triangle
- Rebalance SpiderEgg hunting? Give them Loot?
- perk for civilians (e.g. caravan guys), called "First Aid", making: Injuries you treat during battle are removed instead
- move weapon mastery effects into the weapon mastery itself, instead of being implemented by the skills
- make alps more smart on overworld (stalk player during day)
	- Make it so alps are more aggressive, but they dislike roads. So you are very safe against them while on roads
		- Maybe they dont get a movement bonus anywhere
- prevent allied parties from following you, just because you are being targeted by their allies. Sometimes mercenary companies/nobles think they can/should attack you but you are still allied
- Make raider playstyle more sufficient by giving caravans consistent tool loot
- Maybe remove the replacement of Brawny, Colossus and Fortified Mind on NPCs. Reforged has stepped away from these perks and mods might introduce new secondary effects on them?

- make throwing weapons into hybrid weapon types to profit from axe/spear/flail perks
- make disloyal have more of a downside
- Dynamic Duo You deal 50% less damage to your partner
- Display mood icon during events (Turn that sprite visible / rendertotexture to false/true?)
- Prevent AI from shieldwalling when its the only one left (unless they have rebuke/riposte)
- Add more exclusive groups to various Background
- New AI Behavior for Shield Seargeant (Includes current shield skills and scans for each whether allies profit from it too)
- Add information in Docs that Anatomist and Oathtaker are unsupported
- Prevent cheese where one puts their best bros on the bench in response to a hopeless ambush
- Rework supply-system: If you max out a supply, all remaining ones stay in the inventory instead of being voided
- Shield Skill/attack damage prediction (destruction prediction?)
	- Function for calculating the worth of any single entity
- AI Logic:
		- This already exists in Vanilla, just listing it here because it stay in contrast to the danger
	- Function for calculating the danger of any single entity in isolation
		- This function will look at the targeted entities surrounding to evaluate this
			- e.g. are they an axe wielder near shield users?
			- are they a hammer user next to characters with no armor left?
		- An archer who is in melee is not a huge amount of danger but might still have a lot of "worth" to us, if he is high level or the only enemy arche
- make it so multiple NPC bannerman dont stick together and spread out
- improve visibility during night (overlay night color). Instead the A moon could be visible in the top middle
- Custom Names on enemy Leader and Champions is cool and flavorful, but it gets increasingly confusing as it makes it much harder to identify them correctly. What their base troop is.
	- Maybe there can be a middle ground. Some custom name but also the original name still alongside
	- Maybe a Setting can disable custom names on enemies
- Put Anticipation on some enemies instead of Nimble
- Hitpoint Mults on some injuries -> Injury Threshold Mult / Damage Dealt Mult / get dazed when hit
	- grazed_kidney_injury 60%
	- cut_throat_injury 50%
	- stabbed_guts_injury 40%
	- weakened_heart_injury 30%
- Infrit new skill "Armor as a Weapon": Deal more damage equal to your total remaining armor as a percentage
- expirable potions (so you are forced to use them and so they can be sold/given out more frequently)
- Scrapper-Retinue member making it so armor damage above a certain threshold (e.g. at least 50 per hit) produces tools fx effect
- Make "Obtain" quests harder. E.g. by starting in an ambush or by making the location hidden by default
- nerf ports (to make good maps less reliable on them)
	- setVirtualTime when using ports (to pass time) - This does not work. VirtualTime has nothing to do with DayCount
- usings just fists (empty throwing weapon) with no offhand should also grant 20% fatigue discount (like from double grip)
- Unwieldy Weapons could lose reach when engage in melee
	- Currently its very weird that its the best play to switch to a pike before ending your turn to maximize reach during opponents turn
- Nested Tooltips for faction/city banner to see relation
- burning damage destroys zombie corpses
	- Needs more research into how corpse removal affects loot
	- This is unlikely to affect corpses that are about to be resurrecte, as those arent marked as "consumable"
- Improve AI by taking into account whether they are already known to the player. And make them prefer steping onto tiles that are already revealed to the player
- Make it so the winner of AI battles also gets all look spawned by the opponents 'getDroppedLoot' function.
	- Or rather whenever a unit dies during an AI battle, the result of that function is pushed into its party Loot
- Docs: Make list of existing functions, that this mod overwrites
- Make three headed flail only hit once during opponents turn (or have it have less chance to hit)
- Display vision of currently active entity, by outlining border of view field on tiles
	- Grey out the tiles not visible to the current entity
- New enemy skill "Gravecall" for ancient undead
- new hostility state with factions, where they dont give you contracts but are not yet hostile to you
- New effect given to defender of camps, called "Defender's Advantage". It grants +1 Vision and +10 Resolve. Maybe some other buffs. It reads "You know this place in and out, you have a natural advantage defending it"
- new DayCreated member for locations
	- Can be used to adjust scaling so that newly created locations scale slower than ones already there longer?
	- Can be used for upgrading, so that locations left along can upgrade into stronger versions?
	- Can be used for rumors, where they say: "Recently a new location has appeared there and there"
- Change the campfire story events to always consume a little food but also always provide a random tavern rumor
- remove fatigue-on-hit from most attacks, except specialized weapons (hammer, mace)
- rework of the repair system?
	- remove "repair for profit" system, e.g. by removing the fact that price is calcualted by condition
	- Raise minimum sell price of condition gear to 50%? This would reduce the profit from tool repairs by half
- Make End Turn no longer waste all AP?
	- Make Vigilant explicitely spend all your remaining AP when ending turn
	- Make Command being able to target allies who ended their turns already (if that does not cause too many issues)
- Auto Focus the input boxes during campaign creation. Support Enter/Backspace to move forward and backwards during that screen. Both are a bit tricky because the js code is a huge block
- selling quiver returns their ammo to the player pool?
- Make brothers dying in battle more punishing, mood wise (out of combat). To prevent you disposing unwanted brothers this way or discouraging using unwanted brothers as fodder
- Raise fatigue cost of high tier two-handed weapons beyond 15 again
- Clean up Readme section "For Modder": add default values consitently; add new subsubsections "New Events", "General Decisions"
- add small delay after new round, before reanimation begines (100ms) so that new-round effects are more visible
- Make Anticipation influence attacker with stuns to be more likely to attack
- Automatically transform stamina-debuffs into fatigue-cost-increase for non-attacks
- Make Schrat headless? Would help with one with the shield. And they dont seem to be decapitatable (check this)
- Make Oathtaker only have 2 armor perks (always Medium)
- Make Caravans have more resources (protection), the more they dont arrive at their destination
- Dislocated Shoulder: Only affect skill cost?
- Give sergeants Fresh&Furious (to help with their command skills)
- Debug Setting, for debugging AI decision made from getQueryTargetMultAsUser and getQueryTargetMultAsTarget functions
- Allow renaming of Dogs (its item name is already serialized, just need the UI)
- Cap the cost of moving over terrain to the maximum Stamina of the character
- make ctrl+mousewheel change the camera levels
- See if fatality chance of vanilla weapons can be raised from 99 to 100, with a few backend tweaks (maybe already possible)
- Autogenerato Wiki Pages as markdown format, from ingame state (weapons, backgrounds, perk groups)
	- Even images can be autogenerated as they can be fetched from ingame, and then moved into the correct position of the wiki repository
- Remove hiring discount from recruiter
- add onGetHit sfx for obstacles and trigger those, when they are hit by an aoe attack or an strayed shot
- melon mugger event causing a downside, when you take him. For example losing some renown
- Play start of turn animations + sfx (e.g. inspiring presence) slightly delayed, while keeping the actual effect instant
- Add preview of affected tiles, or tiles that the target would be displaced to on success (the feature that SSU has)
- Do a list of new mechanics
- stackable arena fights?
- remove Brawny again from enemies?
- Show current bros with gladiator necklaces
- Holy Water
	- Increase holy water duration to 5 turns and reduce damage accordingly so that it ends up dealing the same total damage, just slower (nerf)
	- Make it available more common
	- prevent it from randomly spreading
- Hidden ZoC skill for three headed flail that only hits once (to reduce effectiveness in keeping enemies in ZoC)
- Trader Retinue: 10% more movement speed on roads
- Make Ancient Spire enterable repeatidly. But each time you need to choose a brother, who then receives the exhausted debuff for a few days
- After killing enemy with named gear in the arena, offer that piece for sale in the shop (maybe other gear too)
- World Location Icon for when it is a legendary location
- Make some contracts pay in items instead of gold (part of the reward). And allow player to negotiate that away
- Rework this whole Reforged System of any mastery being able to specialize you in skills, that another mastery would provide.
	- Instead the weapon mastery should be rewritten to only grant effects, that can be applied from within the mastery
- Allow Ironwill potion in the bagslot to be used during battle
- Spawnposition Framework: several properties, that troops can use to define, where they like to be ideally positioned, within a formation
	- e.g. Center, Flank, Front, Back, Farback
- Highlight adjacent opponents, that exert zone of control onto the players tile, whenever a brothers turn starts (option), either forever, or until does does an action
- Brothers that die during sunken library, when you fail/flee the fight, will be part of the enemy roster during the next time (probably needs savegame )
- Make it so that characters who move to a certain tile are already considered to be at the tile during the movement (from the character and tile pov)
- Make sure, Lindwurms only move into tiles, where the tail can follow
- Second Ammunition Slot
- New active skill for **Scout** perk called **Callout**
	- **Callout** costs 4-5 AP and can target any enemy ranged troop
		- That troop deals 20% less ranged damage against yourself and adjacent allies for one turn
	- **Callout** targets 7 tiles
		- You and all adjacent allies take 20% less damage from the targeted enemies
		- You and adjacent allies take 10% more damage from any non-targeted enemies
- API: New virtual getMarkTargets() function for skills,
		- which returns a list of all targets,
		- that should be marked (similar to when you highlight them in the turn sequence bar)
		- while you hover over the tooltip of that effect
	- This can be used for example to show all targets, that you currently have in your **Formidable Approach** list
	- Or for a new **Callout** skill
- New "wake up" skill for all humans, which removes 1 turn of 'stunned' from an adjacent character. Costs 6 AP and 20 fatigue. User must not be engaged in melee
- lightning damage to always hit the head
- make punctured gear more likely to drop in the actual quality left
- Holy Water use case:
	- Destroy undead corpses
- Prevent camps from spawning defenders, while player is nearby
- Prevent camps from joining overworld fights or being attackable while other enemies are nearby

## Wishlist for Reforged
- Moddable Perk Descriptions (Currently you have to overwrite the perk descriptions)
- Improve Weapon Preview (using dummy player) to also respect the removal of those via hooks (as a result currently you have overwrite the onAdded)
- Serialize Perk Groups, so that they will still be found/shown, even if a mod removes or adds one perk to them

## New Content:
	- Make Flesh Cradles destructable (e.g. 100 hp 100 armor). Make them much more attractive to NPCs (anti-dog tech)
	- Make flesh pull cause a negative morale check
	- Make greater flesh golem corpse explosions stronger

## Undead Faction:
- Less resurrection but more resolve checks (e.g. around resurrecting zombie)
	- e.g. resurrection chance = 50%, but them resurrecting causes morale check on adjacent characters?

- Give Ijirok Second Wind and a Unhold Sweep Melee Attack for 4 AP and a Zone of Control Attack
	- Chance its AI to only use the 4 AP after Second Wind for the sweep

	"Your attacks at a distance of 4 or less tiles have " + ::MSU.Text.colorPositive("+10%") + " chance to hit",
- Crossbow Mastery
	- Crossbow Mastery making them in your bag always loaded
	- Swap Crossbow with Shield for free once per turn
- Relentless:
	- Using wait or recover does not inflict initiative penalty
	- You can wait an additional time each turn
	- Misses against you while waiting does not build up fatigue
misses dont build up fatigue on you while waiting
These Perks (top = higher prio) im still unhappy with and eventually want to adjust
- Feral Rage
- Mauler
	- replace second effect with 15% more damage when hitting body parts that have no remaining armor
		- Alternative: Deal +25% critical damage for every injury on the target (no matter which bodypart you target)
	- reduce injury threshold of your attacks by 10% per bleed in target
		- keep bleed stack effect
- Bloodlust
	- When you start your turn next to bleeding enemies (or maybe bleeding yourself) gain a temporary bonus depending on the amount of bleeding enemies
		- Rewards Initiative/Adrenaline gameplay

- Take Aim Perk (previously Power Shot)
	- Whenever you wait or end your turn, gain a stacking +5% chance to hit. All bonus is lost, when you attack or move.

- orc slayer / crusader events, make them cost 5k crowns each to hire those guys
- Schrat can target enemies through objects?
- Give barbarian Madman (icy cave) fast adaptation
- when you press the hotkey of a targetable skill, remove old tooltip and generate new one. This is to replace the generic enemy tooltip with one showing hitchance
- Improve sell margin of food to make trading with those more interesting

## Enemies
- Reduce Defense of Assassins, make it so they rely only on Dodge

## AI
- Make AI less likely to use shieldwall while in a net
- make unholds value highground less
- New Strategy of individual enemies, called "Stalling":
	- They prefer defensive over offensive actions and try to stay alive as long as possible
- Write AP prediction for new sanguinary effect for player and enemies (could be done by simulating a 3 AP discount on all 1-range skills targetting a certain enemy)
- Utilize existing hiding-ai-behavior to improve some enemies (e.g. direwolves, ghouls or fast bandits)
- Make AI use Roundswing less often
- Fleeing enemies engaged in melee at the map border do not seek out the border. Instead they flee alongside it
- Player: Make fleeing player characters actually leave the battle when at the border
- Unholds should use throw more often to counter rebuke/flailing swingy stuff
- Make it so enemies are less likely to remove the net if it doesnt affect them (e.g. Orcs)
- Change AI Rotation to not/rarely rotate your brothers into battle?
- Make enemy archers prefer to use wait instead of blindly advancing, if their frontline hasn't advanced yet
	- Make make enemy archers prefer wait during the first turn in general, if they have no target?
- Lower the urge for nachzehrers to kill themselves to ZOC just to seek out a corpse
- Make someone with **Crowded** less likely to be targeted by displacement skills (knock back/repel). That would only help those
- If thrower uses last throwing weapon, mak them switch to melee weapon immediately
- make NPCs with Formidable Approach more likely to move to tiles with adjacent enemies which they dont yet have in their list or which are confident with less max HP

## Fix:
- Currently Swing and Hit sfx happen at the same time, which is unrealistic
	- Make hit sfx come with a slight (e.g. 100ms) delay instead
	- Problem: Vanilla allows a delay for hit sounds, but the receiving entity moan sounds have no adjustable delay
- Enemies that gain shieldwall from shield sergeant while not visible to the player, wont lose the shieldwall animation, until some ui update happens on them (e.g. getting attacked)
	- Can be reproduced by fighting nomads with a leader. No Idea, how exactly that is caused
- footprints of barbarian kings dont seem to produce tooltip for lookout
- keep track of non-spawning ifrits and the loot potentially lost by those an attach it to the remaining one
- Sometimes on the World map, a single mouse wheel roll zooms the camera completely. Probably has to do with some timer running too far
- dog ai too fast, not realizing reanimating zombies and dying to ZOC hits
- Make Rotate no longer cause resolve checks
- Fix orcs sometimes using charge, even though they decided to give up
- Alps that teleport during first turn before revealing, might be shown as unknown, even though you can see them because they arrived on visible tiles
- Look into Recover being blocked by worn down, but still showing as active, when previewing another skill
- debug zombies
	- No Idea, I ran out of ideas following the lead of updateVisibility calls. I assumed that Zombies pushing other zombies, after my turn starts, messes something up. But that didnt do it
	- found kinda a potential solution, see discord



- Make Mercenaries, that you help in fights, sometimes giving you one of their painted shield as a thank-you to remember them by

## Rework Training Hall
- Once per battle if you start your turn fleeing and not adjacent to an enemy, recover your morale to steady
- Attacks cost +1 AP and have +15% chance to hit

## For Reforged
- Anonymous Damage Sources (bleed, fire, poison), count as if the target dealt damage to themselves regarding the experience-sharing
	-> Those anonymous damage sources steal experience from the player, even if the player applied them
	- Count anonymous damage sources (when someone deals damage to themselves) as a new faction (Faction.None)

## Backlog
- Reduce bleeding noise
	- Cant fix right now, because 'refresh' only supports increased stacks by 1. Reforged suffers the same problem when inflicting 3 bleed via Gouge for example


# WIP

- Black Monolith only during night

## For modder:
- Framework for tracking round number of a skill for an entity https://github.com/MSUTeam/MSU/issues/351
- New world_state function called "hourly update", which is called once per hour (just like the update from asset manager)
	- However this is also called, whenever certain notable actions happen. For example, when the player teleports around/uses the port, or onCombatFinished (fastTravelTo)
		- Actually updateTopbarAssets is really convenient in that regard
- improve orc berserker AI to use stun charge too
	- their weird choice of setting EngageTargetMultipleOpponentsMult = -1.0,
		- makes it so the resulting ScoreMult is negative with odd numbers of ZoC enemies and positive with equal numbers
		- will add tilescores (which isnt even too bad). While a positive value there would remove tilescore
	- ai_charge is mainly handled via `ai_engage_melee`
	- in a simple 1v1 test the berserk uses his charge just fine
	-> maybe a total rewrite of ai_engage_melee is in order

### Fix
- local r = this.Math.rand(100, 200) * 0.01; in send_supplies_action gets overwritten later on, causing weird rewards
- Play other animations also slightly staggered (e.g. fleeing animation) to counter act the lag a bit

### Feature
- Contracts which change morale/renown/relation but are not yet covered, display those in the next screen
- add system where equipped loot is only decided upon once, whether it drops. So if a dead character reanimates and dies again you dont have more chances to loot that gear
- First Aid (enemy-only for now)
	"A steady hand and the right supplies can mean the difference between life and death."
	"You don’t just fight—you mend, patch, and keep your allies standing."
	- Skills from bag items cost -1 Action Point
	- Once per battle, when you use a bag item on yourself or an adjacent ally, recover 20 Hitpoints on the target
- Vanish (enemy-only for now)
	- After taking damage, teleport to a random adjacent tile that is not in zone of control

### Misc
- User-Faced Changelog (actual changes)
- Modder Faced one (migrating mods)

## MV
- Tests (logs printing) whether ai multiplier for skills are even working


- shieldwall animation bug at the start of the combat
	- Happens when you dont see them when they gain this effect

- look into the debug log vanilla recently removed from skill container printing. Maybe i dont need to skip that anymore in hardened


- Make it so ranged troop AI is less likely to be dumb (leave perfectly fine positions)
	- Often times ranged troops go before their melee army.
		- In this case they should actively wait, realising that they first need to see how their melee troops behave
		- Alternatively they should move only very slightly forward and/or only into cover

from Modular Vanilla

- rework dropchance of items to make daggering later in the game more worth for farming money
	- Make it more likely to drop while at full condition
	- make it less likely to drop while at lower condition
	- Make items drop much closer to the condition that they had

- Make Infected Wound not heal, while no medical supplies are left
- Make Infected Wound stop healing of all present untreated injuries, until medical supplies are there

- Tooltip for economic difficulty changes

- Make world parties that are left with 1 troop after auto-battle disappear. Otherwise you get parties with a single necromancer or hexen or barbarian king

- turn order predictions for next round

- AI: more likely to push back kingfisher guys who are currently netting someone, if the push back tile would break the net
- Remove whirling stance when stunned

- Add Retribution to Tough Bandits (up from Pillager). Remove Survival Instinct from all low tier thug bandits
	- Maybe add Resilint to all Tough Bandits?

- sfx when the target of kingfisher dies (as if you reel in the net)
- kingfisher gets dazed, when target frees itself from net
- split shield does not update the shield correctly
- ghost fights might have to do with alliances not being created correctly. Maybe the new southern settlements interfere with the placement for hard-coded alliances

## Camp Rework
- Camping requires 1-2 hours to set up
- Effect:
	- Protects you against ambushes
	- Makes you immune to being attacked by Alps
	- More repair specialized
	- More Hitpoint Recovery (even more than Vanilla)
- Requires 1-2 hours to de-construct and move on

- Utilize this way of verifying the caller, from Reforged:
::TacticalNavigator.teleport <- function( _user, _targetTile, _func, _data, _bool, _float = 1.0 )
{
	local caller = ::getstackinfos(2).locals["this"];
	if (!::isKindOf(caller, "skill") || !(caller in ::Reforged.ScheduleSkills))
	{
		teleport(_user, _targetTile, _func, _data, _bool, _float);
		return;
	}

- Mirro the reason of bad relation change for noble houses if it is because of actions against one of their settlements

- Footwork Goblin Overseer

- Remove "Throw" skill from Bog Unholds, as a result of them having split shield. Throw was one answer against shields

- Make enemies blocked by 2 tiles twice as likely to divert attacks
- Make necromancer able to retreat

- Improve Readme by writing out price changes to shields and weight changes to quivers

- Hireable Sellswords that spawn with a shield have that in another mercenaries color scheme
- Add mention in morale check concept about how there is a random roll happening against resolve and being influenced by adjacent allies/enemies

### Poise System
- utilize modular vanilla Ai score framework to make AI more capable of predicting stun outcomes
- poise system log for stun breakdown: "Foo dealt X Poise Damage to Baz (Y) [, causing a Z turn stun]

MOdular Vanilla:
- also activate preview movement while AI is considering a path for (turns for attack)

- make necromancer resurrect themselves and be able to cast spells then ???
- make gladiator attachements a bit heavier

- make camps ignore minimum distance to each other, if mountain is in between

- make blunt and cutting attacks deal 2 damage to shields instead of 1

- prevent paint being usable on items that already have this color (if the variant doesnt change after applying the paint, the paint is not used)
- Only use Paint and spawn sfx, if the Variant of the affected item is different, after calling onPaint on it

- reduce brigand party loot; make individual brigands drop loot (fast = gold, ranged = ammo, tough = food, balanced = ???)

- make killing frenzy/berserk AI prefer targets that they can one-shot/kill

- fleeing enemies grant 100% of their xp?

- turn order prediction
	- Could be realised by slotting in a dummy/separator entity into the turn sequence bar at the very end?

- Howler Monkey sfx for some kind of beast
- Look into Marshals Armor (also armor from other types of enemies that use brigandine)

- cross mod compatibility with crock pot? (vulture threat keyword)
- draw combat steps red, while the active entity is in zone of control
	- they are handled in the .exe (steps_bot_left, steps_top, etc.)
- show total number of people in turn sequence bar somewhere (e.g. behind current number of viewed actor)

### Todo
- barbarian:
	- 40% chance for roaming parties to have no unholds
	- 20% chance for camps to have no unholds
- Make many skills and attacks from within a bush reveal that character to all enemies, not just the immediate target

- prevent cheese where you can find out whether someone is hiding in a bush by trying to pathfind into that bush
	- same thing is true for fog of war
- make spider corpses a bit more transparent, less colored, so that they differ more from alive ones
	- or make alive ones in a more vibrant color

- Feature: Manual Snapshot for brother-gear, that can be manually reset. Useful for when you swap out a lot of gear before a fight

- API: hook onQueryTargetTile to implement new ai function
- add debug logs for finding the end of battle bug
- Make root skills much more likely to target someone with Unstoppable stacks (because they cancel unstoppable)

- nerf ancient gladius
- give bag slot weapons a offset to the top left so simulate depth and make them more visible with attachements on
	- maybe increase their size slightly too?
	- this does not work outside of combat


- broken shield glitch (outside of combat the paperdoll shield looks healthy while the shield brush is damaged). all whn the shield is damaged
	- probably just make it not look broken outside of battle (or maybe that is already the case and what is missing is just an update?)

- reduce ranged damage dealt to enemies in cover
- make dodge also grant 5% initiative as defense if at least one adjacent tile is empty
- dodge: misses against you build no fatigue, while at least one adjacent tile is empty
- dont display injuries in temple that are "healed by tomorrow" anyways
- make disloyal make negative mood fade away slower

- new type of tooltip that displays whenever the player previews movement
	- am I in zone of control?
		- if yes, whats all the hitchances?
	- whats the total AP and Fatigeu cost of the movement?
	- how much does each tile cost to move through?

- Bloodlust:
	- +10% Armor Penetration against enemies that are not currently bleeding
	- When attacking someone with less Resolve, inflict an additional Bleeding stack
	- When attacking someone with less Initiative, inflict an additional Bleeding stack
	- When attacking someone whose turn has not started yet, inflict n additional bleeding stack


- make NPC ammo limited
	- make NPC Defender have unlimited ammunition
- Make **Gash** deal more damage for every bleed on the target?
- look into sorting of enemy types in combat dialog
	- most important ones should be sorted to the top
	- make it scrollable
- Concept for Auto-Retreat

## Todo
- split hyena/nachzehrer troops
- make formidable approach characters more likely to be targeted by rotation-like skills if that pots them next to new enemies or removes confident from enemies potentially
- color adjacent enemies, that exert ZOC onto you in a color, when previewing movement out of ZOC
- remove bandit leader unique names?
	- alternatively: show their type name?

- resilient nerf to -2 turn effect duration (from -5), so that certain poisons still apply
- make camping reduce food consumption?
- remove dodge from frenzied direwolfs
- increase fatigue cost of whirling stance

- armor types:
worst
- scale
- lamellar
- mail
- plate
best

show uncapped hitchance
- fix(vanilla) parties on world map that concluded fights, still counting as on-going battles
- when viewing ground items during battle, turn those items grey, which can't be equipped because
	- not enough action points
	- not equippable to the current character
- make antidote remove acid? Maybe a rename is in order then
- make assassins drop night owl elixirs?
- raider retinue:
	- 15% more Movementspeed while chasing a non-location
- alps take 33% more hitpoint changes to head

- new enemy only perk
	- From the Shadows
		- At the start of each round, if no enemy can see you, gain +3 Action Points during this round
	- Is given to Assassins and higher tier Direwolfs
		- They are also tought to stay hidden much more
	- Will spawn a mini-icon while the condition is active

- selling quiver/throwing weapons will grant ammunition depending on their remaining ammo and empty them out in the shop

- brigands
	- make their weapons always have low condition (25-50%)
	- slightly reduce ranged spawnrate. You shouldnt get overwhelmed by their regular ranged troops. thats the job of goblins/nomads

- make enemies that are unknown hidden in the turn sequence bar
- make skills which increase skill cost temporarily, add tooltip entires in those skill tooltips
	- need examples, which are those skills?


- change escorting so that the escorting character adds its strength and numbers to the army it is escorting
	- not very useful, while this only affects the player and what he is escorting. Once non-player parties can form groups, it will be useful

- work on a tech to highlight sprites (draw the same brush with the same properties, just behind and in a contrasting color)
	- could be used to highlight adjacent enemies for a second on tunr start

- linebreaker (from onslaught) is not a once-per-turn (happens twice during snowman stream)

- whenever you win a fight, all brothers in reserve get a non-stacking exp buff for the next fight
	- **Eager for Battle**

- brigand poacher only 8 action points?
- colored rumors (extended for reforged rumors)
- sort of marketplace to also sort for buy-price
- give adarga shields 20 rdef again. Otherwise their def is too similar and switching too melee not impactful enough




# Survival Guide

These are noticable changes by Hardened, that might catch you off-guard
- First read the cheese-section on the wiki, so you know what does not work anymore

## Noticable Differences coming from Vanilla

- Nets dont reduce Initiative

- Some enemies can't be disarmed (Orc Warlord, Barbarian King, Hedge Knight, Grand Diviner)
- Some weapons have their AP cost reduced: The main attack from **2H Wooden Hammer**, **2H Wooden Flail** and **Goedendag** cost 5 AP (from 6 AP)
- 2+ tile melee attacks get hitchance penalties for every adjacent enemy
- add renown penalty when entering fight with temporary enemies (= you practically backstab someone who trusted you)
- Your faction (+dogs) must have done the most damage on an enemy in order to get their loost. Kill stealing for loot no longer works

## Noticable Differences coming from Reforged/Vanilla

- Nets dont reduce Initiative
- Some enemies can't be disarmed (Orc Warlord, Barbarian King, Hedge Knight, Grand Diviner)
- You can't puncture someone unless 2+ characters are surrounding them (maybe)

## Noticable Differences coming from Reforged

- Some weapons have their AP cost reduced: **Stab** costs 3 AP (from 4 AP) on all daggers
- Some weapons have their AP cost increased: All Poleflail attacks cost 6 AP (up from 5 AP)

## Noticable Differences coming from Reforged

- Some weapons have their AP cost reduced: **Stab** costs 3 AP (from 4 AP) on all daggers
- Some weapons have their AP cost increased: All Poleflail attacks cost 6 AP (up from 5 AP)





- add renown penalty when entering fight with temporary enemies (= you practically backstab someone who trusted you)
- option for autosaving after battle

- skeleton captains inspiring presence?

# Artwork wanted:

- T1 "Polemace": A long combat stick that doubles as a walking cane
- Malnourished icon ()


For: URUI
- Dont show tile blocking square for tiles that are completely hidden by terrain (because of camera height)

- make orc warlord never spawn with shields
- make footwork rarely be used on the tile that the actor started its turn on (otherwise it too often results in weird dancing/decisions by goblins)

- mirrored items censor

- improve terrain of camp locations by making the terrain in them less "natural"
	- less grass in forest locations
	- dry grass in flatlands
	- less snow in snowy locations

- new type of caravan that transports only gold (because they came back from selling or are about to buy stuff)
	- they look the same as normal caravans except that they move significant faster (like 80% instead of 50%)

- make champions have 50% chance to spawn with weapon vs armor, instead of equal chance for any slot type

- standardize weapon stats, by changing the hidden +20 damage modifer into the weapon itself

- delay first turn of round ai until resurrections are finished

- make drunkard able to target items equipped to brothers

- make relationship with a town reduce the chance of receiving useless rumors (e.g. by switcherooing the follower to on, before the rumors are created)

- add new skill to quickhands perk, which costs 4 AP and removes "Disarmed" effect

- spearwall:
	- only affects 3 tiles
	- gain +1 Reach
	- attack each enemy who enters your zone of control
	- ignore the penalties of "Crowded"
	- lasts until the start of your next turn
	- Differences from Vanilla:
		- deal full damage (up from 50%)
		- enemies are not pushed back
	- Spear Mastery:
		- receive no morale checks from enemies entering your zone of control

- Make Obsidian Dagger instead cause Poison on it to never expire

- make Withered be removed by Recover

- make bodyguards choose their target to protect once per turn
	- and only switch if the old target is dead
	- and only pick targets that need bodyguards

- "Fix" the fat-ping-pong via events on a gluttonous bro
- conqueror armor effect replacement: +15 Ranged Defense during day (enemy are blinded by light reflecting)

- when comparing distances for spawning locations, instead of direct air distance, use the amount of tiles travelled on the shortest path. That way mountains, rivers and swamp will sometimes increase locations possible

- "unknown-faction" flag (literally) for locations, who don't show their defender, or where different factions could be inside
- improve spawn location for holy war POI's to be more central and not spawn at the right/left border

- add new UISkillOrder member for skill.nut, which is only used for the order in the UI (mainly character screen)
	- change moodcheck skill order to be directly after background

- nerf rotation to be in line with vanilla? (25 fatigue)

- bug: projectiles dont seem to be renders all too often
- rumors around position of nearby mercenary companies on the world map
- rumors around nearby undiscovered locations

- nerf riposte to 15 Fatigue

- weapon master requirement is not accurate, it should be moved to the bullet point where it is needed

- miniicon for exploit opening?

- balance between barb mace and spiked mace? latter is more expensive but overall weaker
- Bug: crossbows are not unloaded correctly after battle
	- need more evidence

- Make contracts aligned with either positive or negative morale reputation
	- rebuild/caravan/envoy/packet/great battle are positive aligned (they trust you with something)
	- find thiefs/destroy location are negative aligned (this mission is potentially dangerous, just for you)
	- not aligned: find location, defend against raiding parties

- fix description of swordmaster perks (consussive strikes e.g.)
- icons on top of NPC world parties signaling, whether they can see you and whether they are currently "hunting" you
- make contract payments 10% more random in both directions? (lucky random)
	- this.m.PaymentMult = this.Math.rand(90, 110) * 0.01;

- raise weight of almost all early game armors by an additional 1?

- change automatic camera panning so that it doesnt move the camera for small distances, only when bigger distances are happening

- praetorian need more mdef

- when buying supplies, play animation for the supply values

- New Event: drunken guy thrown out of tavern/town
	- Condition:
		- While near a town (doesnt have to be friendly)
		- Has to be night
		- You have to pay something to the guy
	- You gain a random background with the drunkard trait

- make knock back function return a weighted container with all possible end locations and a chance
	- this can then be used to visualize that

- ancient double layer armor is a bit too good for an ancient variant armor

- make death skull more prominent (I never see it if I dont look for it)

- show tooltip in items which can be bought/sold back at full price

- (crock pot) change birds to not be an attack

- strange meat seems to be treated as valueable food and has much higher sell price

- new perk that grants adjacent allies resolve

- levelup animation
