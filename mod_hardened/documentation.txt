# Description

This submod is a collection of changes to Reforged that I suggested internally that didn't make it into the mod [yet]. In order to still enjoy those ideas/tweaks I made them into this submod for myself; and maybe others.

# Requirements

- Reforged

# Known Issues:

- Enemies may spawn with perks that they can't use anymore (**Duelist**/**Formidable Approach**) because I didn't touch their spawning behaviors in that regard

# Compatibility

- Is safe to remove from- and add to any existing savegames

# Future Plans:

# Changes:

0.2.3
	- fix burning ground freezing the game (caused by the armor penetration cap from 0.2.2)
	- add the weapontype 'Spear' to Goblin Pikes, Ancient Pikes and Pikes
	- add face warpaint to all fast bandits

0.2.2
	- Thrust now has 0% Hitchance bonus (down from 10%)
	- Slash now has 0% Hitchance bonus (down from 5%)
	- 'Wait' now debuffs the actual Initiative until the start of that brothers next turn
	- Armor Penetration is capped at 100%. Any Armor Penetration above 100% has no effect. Reaching 100% Armor Pen still has damage reduction from remaining armor applied.
	- Sprint no longer increases the fatigue cost for moving. Thit was always intended but never in effect due to a typo

0.2.1
	- fix Puncture sometimes not usable/unusable despite its condition being met/not met
	- fix spear advantage not giving any bonus
	- formidable approach now spawns an icon when triggered

0.2.0
	- Completely rework Reach
	- Rework Spear Advantage Perk
	- Rework Formidable Approach Perk
	- Improve dodge tooltip out of combat
	- Require Puncture to have the enemy be surrounded by 2+ enemies
	- Replace Brawny and Fortified Mind with raw stats on all NPCs
	- Remove LogInfos spam in the log
	- Prevent fleeing characters from receiving Inspiring Presence effect

0.1.0
    - released on discord
