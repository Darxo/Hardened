# Description

This submod is a collection of changes to Reforged that I suggested internally that didn't make it into the mod [yet]. In order to still enjoy those ideas/tweaks I made them into this submod for myself; and maybe others.

# Requirements

- Reforged

# Known Issues:

- Enemies may spawn with perks that they can't use anymore (**Duelist**/**Formidable Approach**) because I didn't touch their spawning behaviors in that regard
- Using Recover will prevent you from using **Wait Round** for the rest of this round

# Compatibility

- Is safe to remove from- and add to any existing savegames

# Future Plans:

# Changes:

0.2.5
	- Recover now applies the same Initiative debuff as using Wait
	- Level-Ups for Attribute with 2 stars have -1 to minimum roll and +1 to maximum roll (compared to Vanilla) and are fully randomized in that range (compared to Reforged)
	- Wodden Flail now deals 15-30 damage (up from 10-25) and costs 60 gold (up from 40)
	- Fangshire will no longer spawn at the start of the game

0.2.4
	- reduce action point cost of Stab to 3
	- replace colossus on enemies with equavalent stats
	- hide mini icon for pattern recognition
	- slightly improve reach tooltip
	- fix Brawny on NPCs reducing their Stamina and instead of increasing it
	- fix fall damage and certain other direct damage sources being reduced by armor

0.2.3
	- fix burning ground freezing the game (caused by the armor penetration cap from 0.2.2)
	- add the weapontype 'Spear' to Goblin Pikes, Ancient Pikes and Pikes
	- add face warpaint to all fast bandits

0.2.2
	- Thrust now has 0% Hitchance bonus (down from 10%)
	- Slash now has 0% Hitchance bonus (down from 5%)
	- 'Wait' now debuffs the actual Initiative until the start of that brothers next turn
	- Armor Penetration is capped at 100%. Any Armor Penetration above 100% has no effect. Reaching 100% Armor Pen still has damage reduction from remaining armor applied.
	- Sprint no longer increases the fatigue cost for moving. Thit was always intended but never in effect due to a typo

0.2.1
	- fix Puncture sometimes not usable/unusable despite its condition being met/not met
	- fix spear advantage not giving any bonus
	- formidable approach now spawns an icon when triggered

0.2.0
	- Completely rework Reach
	- Rework Spear Advantage Perk
	- Rework Formidable Approach Perk
	- Improve dodge tooltip out of combat
	- Require Puncture to have the enemy be surrounded by 2+ enemies
	- Replace Brawny and Fortified Mind with raw stats on all NPCs
	- Remove LogInfos spam in the log
	- Prevent fleeing characters from receiving Inspiring Presence effect
