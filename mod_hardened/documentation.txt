# Requirements

- Reforged

# Documentation for Codebase

## API:
- Backend features that don't change anything by themselves
- Re-writes of vanilla features/properties. This might sometimes slightly change how they behave
- API stuff will usually not touch any leaf-scripts
## Non-API:
- Everything else

# Known Issues:

- Map Seeds for Vanilla or Reforged are unlikely to work the same under Hardened
- Injuries now heal at the start of the day and wages are paid at the start of the day; instead of during midday
- Hitchances of Lunge-Like attacks can be inaccurate as the act of moving next to your target can enable/disable various effects
- Oathtaker on existing saves (outside of the Oathtaker Origin), which gained an Oath while playing regular Reforged are stuck with that oath after adding Hardened

# Compatibility with mods

- **Elite Few**: Hardlock, when trying to negotiate for better pay in contracts

# Compatibility

- Is safe to remove from- and add to any existing savegames
