# Description

This submod is a collection of changes to Reforged that I suggested internally that didn't make it into the mod [yet]. In order to still enjoy those ideas/tweaks I made them into this submod for myself; and maybe others.

# Requirements

- Reforged

# Known Issues:

- Enemies may spawn with perks that they can't use anymore (**Duelist**/**Formidable Approach**) because I didn't touch their spawning behaviors in that regard
- Using Recover will prevent you from using **Wait Round** for the rest of this round
- Loading the game over an enemy allows them to instantly engage the player in battle
- **Shield Sergeant** can push multiple enemies into the same tile when used with **Line Breaker**

# Compatibility

- Is safe to remove from- and add to any existing savegames

# Future Plans:
- Hide information about enemy composition on the battle field
- Only reveal attacking/casting entities if they are on a tile which is already discovered by the player. This should make scouting/high vision more important
- certain unholds/high end orcs being able to throw their own allies behind their back in order to advance into tight spaces
- Make it so Hook will also move the guy who does the hooking one tile back
- change handgonne aoe pattern in some directions to a triangle
- Rebalance SpiderEgg hunting? Give them XP/Loot?
- Rebalance enemy skills/perks considering hardened reworks
- Fix orcs sometimes using charge, even though they decided to give up
- Fix perma stunning enemies on the world map
- Fix enemy AI ranged arrow magnet (they choose big groups over actually vulnerable targets). Ifrits choosing the shield guy in the middle, instead of the low rdef guys around him
- Give bros +1 AP while retreating
- gambeson coloring
- nerf cover ally initiative bonus and give it additional defense
- opportunist to work with all throwing weapons
- New parry mechanic? Could be a perk that only works if you are not wearing a shield but a melee weapon. Core feature would be a *cling* sound when you parry. It should work seemlessly with Riposte and Rebuke.
	- Maybe getting a melee defense bonus if you didn't attack during your turn? For example three times your reach as melee defense
- remove fatigue build up prevention from shield expert (it still does too much)
- perk for civilians (e.g. caravan guys), called "First Aid", making: Injuries you treat during battle are removed instead
- rewrite reach tooltip in combat tooltip
