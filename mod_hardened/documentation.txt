# Main Changes

- Disable Veteran Perks

### Reach Rework

- Reach Advantage always grants 13% increased Melee Skill

## Additions
- New 'Battle Song' skill while holding a 'Lute' for applying a temporary Resolve buff to nearby allies

## Balance

### Perks
- Dodge effect is now depending on the adjacent empty tiles
- Duelist only works for one-handed weapons. The Penetration is now also halfed with 2 enemies and disabled with 3+
- Rework Formidable Approach to only works for Two-Handed weapons, grant 15 Melee Skill instead of Reach and trigger a morale check on approaching enemies
- Rework Spear Advantage to double the effect of Reach Advantage on you
- Inspiring Presence no longer requires a banner but is only active for the brother with the highest resolve among all brothers with that perk
- Inspiring Presence now proccs on Round-Start instead of Turn-Start and only affects brothers with less resolve than the Leader
- The skill 'Sprint' is no longer part of the perk 'Pathfinder' and now it's part of the perk 'Footwork'. 'Footwork' has been renamed to 'Escape Artist'

### Other

## Quality of Life

- Brawny and Fortified Mind on all NPCs are now replaced with an equivalent amount of stats

## Requirements ###

- Reforged

## Known Issues: ###

- Enemies may spawn with perks that they can't use anymore (Duelist/Formidable Approach) because I didn't touch their spawning behaviors in that regard

## Compatibility ###

- Should be safe to remove from- and add to running games and should not corrupt anything upon removal
- Should be safe to remove from- and add to any existing savegames

## Future Plans: ###
