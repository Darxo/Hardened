# Description

This submod is a collection of changes to Reforged that I suggested internally that didn't make it into the mod [yet]. In order to still enjoy those ideas/tweaks I made them into this submod for myself; and maybe others.

# Requirements

- Reforged

# Documentation for Codebase

## API:
- Backend features that don't change anything by themselves
- Re-writes of vanilla features/properties. This might sometimes slightly change how they behave
- API stuff will usually not touch any leaf-scripts
## Non-API:
- Everything else

# Known Issues:

- Loading the game over an enemy allows them to instantly engage the player in battle

# Compatibility

- Is safe to remove from- and add to any existing savegames
