### Description ###

Write a short summary about what your mod does without going into specific. This text can then be copy&pasted and used whenever you publish the mod

### Main Changes ###

- Veteran Perks are disabled

## Additions
- New 'Battle Song' skill while holding a 'Lute' for applying a temporary Resolve buff to nearby allies

## Balance
- Dodge effect is now depending on the adjacent empty tiles
- Duelist only works for one-handed weapons. The Penetration is now also halfed with 2 enemies and disabled with 3+
- Formidable Approach only works for Two-Handed weapons
- Inspiring Presence no longer requires a banner but is only active for the brother with the highest resolve among all brothers with that perk
- Inspiring Presence now proccs on Round-Start instead of Turn-Start and only affects brothers with less resolve than the Leader
- The skill 'Sprint' is no longer part of the perk 'Pathfinder' and now it's part of the perk 'Footwork'. 'Footwork' has been renamed to 'Escape Artist'

## Quality of Life
