# Description

This submod is a collection of changes to Reforged that I suggested internally that didn't make it into the mod [yet]. In order to still enjoy those ideas/tweaks I made them into this submod for myself; and maybe others.

# Requirements

- Reforged

# Known Issues:

- Enemies may spawn with perks that they can't use anymore (**Duelist**/**Formidable Approach**) because I didn't touch their spawning behaviors in that regard
- Using Recover will prevent you from using **Wait Round** for the rest of this round

# Compatibility

- Is safe to remove from- and add to any existing savegames

# Future Plans:

# Changes:

0.2.5

	- Level-Ups for Attribute with 2 stars have -1 to minimum roll and +1 to maximum roll (compared to Vanilla) and are fully randomized in that range (compared to Reforged)

0.2.4
	- reduce action point cost of Stab to 3
	- replace colossus on enemies with equavalent stats

	- fix Brawny on NPCs reducing their Stamina and instead of increasing it
