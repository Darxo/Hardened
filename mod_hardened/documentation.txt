# Description

This submod is a collection of changes to Reforged that I suggested internally that didn't make it into the mod [yet]. In order to still enjoy those ideas/tweaks I made them into this submod for myself; and maybe others.

# Requirements

- Reforged

# Known Issues:

- Using Recover will prevent you from using **Wait Round** for the rest of this round
- Loading the game over an enemy allows them to instantly engage the player in battle
- **Shield Sergeant** can push multiple enemies into the same tile when used with **Line Breaker**

# Compatibility

- Is safe to remove from- and add to any existing savegames

# Future Plans:
- Hide information about enemy composition on the battle field
- certain unholds/high end orcs being able to throw their own allies behind their back in order to advance into tight spaces
- change handgonne aoe pattern in some directions to a triangle
- Rebalance SpiderEgg hunting? Give them Loot?
- gambeson coloring
- nerf cover ally initiative bonus and give it additional defense
- perk for civilians (e.g. caravan guys), called "First Aid", making: Injuries you treat during battle are removed instead
- move weapon mastery effects into the weapon mastery itself, instead of being implemented by the skills
- make alps more smart on overworld (stalk player during day)
	- Make it so alps are more aggressive, but they dislike roads. So you are very safe against them while on roads
		- Maybe they dont get a movement bonus anywhere
- prevent allied parties from following you, just because you are being targeted by their allies. Sometimes mercenary companies/nobles think they can/should attack you but you are still allied
- Make raider playstyle more sufficient by giving caravans consistent tool loot
- Maybe remove the replacement of Brawny, Colossus and Fortified Mind on NPCs. Hardened has stepped away from these perks and mods might introduce new secondary effects on them?
- Make it so ranged troop AI is less likely to be dumb (leave perfectly fine positions)
	- Often times ranged troops go before their melee army.
		- In this case they should actively wait, realising that they first need to see how their melee troops behave
		- Alternatively they should move only very slightly forward and/or only into cover
- include my more indirect numeral mod
- fruits of labor ramping up until level 10
- make throwing weapons into hybrid weapon types to profit from axe/spear/flail perks
- make disloyal have more of a downside
- Dynamic Duo You deal 50% less damage to your partner
- Display mood icon during events (Turn that sprite visible / rendertotexture to false/true?)
- Prevent AI from shieldwalling when its the only one left (unless they have rebuke/riposte)
- Add more exclusive groups to various Background
- New AI Behavior for Shield Seargeant (Includes current shield skills and scans for each whether allies profit from it too)
- Add information in Docs that Anatomist and Oathtaker are unsupported
- Prevent cheese where one puts their best bros on the bench in response to a hopeless ambush
- Rework supply-system: If you max out a supply, all remaining ones stay in the inventory instead of being voided
- Shield Skill/attack damage prediction (destruction prediction?)
- AI Logic:
	- Function for calculating the worth of any single entity
		- This already exists in Vanilla, just listing it here because it stay in contrast to the danger
	- Function for calculating the danger of any single entity in isolation
		- This function will look at the targeted entities surrounding to evaluate this
			- e.g. are they an axe wielder near shield users?
			- are they a hammer user next to characters with no armor left?
		- An archer who is in melee is not a huge amount of danger but might still have a lot of "worth" to us, if he is high level or the only enemy archer
- understand MSU cost prediction and apply it for reworked Leverage
- make it so multiple NPC bannerman dont stick together and spread out
- improve visibility during night (overlay night color). Instead the A moon could be visible in the top middle
- Custom Names on enemy Leader and Champions is cool and flavorful, but it gets increasingly confusing as it makes it much harder to identify them correctly. What their base troop is.
	- Maybe there can be a middle ground. Some custom name but also the original name still alongside
	- Maybe a Setting can disable custom names on enemies
- Put Anticipation on some enemies instead of Nimble
- Hitpoint Mults on some injuries -> Injury Threshold Mult / Damage Dealt Mult / get dazed when hit
	- grazed_kidney_injury 60%
	- cut_throat_injury 50%
	- stabbed_guts_injury 40%
	- weakened_heart_injury 30%
- Infrit new skill "Armor as a Weapon": Deal more damage equal to your total remaining armor as a percentage
- expirable potions (so you are forced to use them and so they can be sold/given out more frequently)
- Make it so wait can not be used if you have less than half of your AP remaining?
- Make certain items unsellable
- Scrapper-Retinue member making it so armor damage above a certain threshold (e.g. at least 50 per hit) produces tools. But
- Make "Obtain" quests harder. E.g. by starting in an ambush or by making the location hidden by default
- nerf ports (to make good maps less reliable on them)
	- setVirtualTime when using ports (to pass time) - This does not work. VirtualTime has nothing to do with DayCount
- usings just fists (empty throwing weapon) with no offhand should also grant 20% fatigue discount (like from double grip)
- Unwieldy Weapons could lose reach when engage in melee
	- Currently its very weird that its the best play to switch to a pike before ending your turn to maximize reach during opponents turn
- Nested Tooltips for faction/city banner to see relation
- burning damage destroys zombie corpses
	- Needs more research into how corpse removal affects loot
	- This is unlikely to affect corpses that are about to be resurrecte, as those arent marked as "consumable"
- Improve AI by taking into account whether they are already known to the player. And make them prefer steping onto tiles that are already revealed to the player
- Make it so the winner of AI battles also gets all look spawned by the opponents 'getDroppedLoot' function.
	- Or rather whenever a unit dies during an AI battle, the result of that function is pushed into its party Loot
- Docs: Make list of existing functions, that this mod overwrites
- Make three headed flail only hit once during opponents turn (or have it have less chance to hit)
- Display vision of currently active entity, by outlining border of view field on tiles
	- Grey out the tiles not visible to the current entity
- New enemy skill "Gravecall" for ancient undead
- Kingfisher Rename -> Entangler?
	- Close the distance, and snare your foe with a net in the heat of Battle
- If a Brother dies for sure, a special ghost animation could be played. Maybe something like the Geist death or a spiritual soul leaving the body towards the sky
- new hostility state with factions, where they dont give you contracts but are not yet hostile to you
- New effect given to defender of camps, called "Defender's Advantage". It grants +1 Vision and +10 Resolve. Maybe some other buffs. It reads "You know this place in and out, you have a natural advantage defending it"
- new DayCreated member for locations
	- Can be used to adjust scaling so that newly created locations scale slower than ones already there longer?
	- Can be used for upgrading, so that locations left along can upgrade into stronger versions?
	- Can be used for rumors, where they say: "Recently a new location has appeared there and there"
- revert some 5 AP two handed weapons
- Change the campfire story events to always consume a little food but also always provide a random tavern rumor
- remove fatigue-on-hit from most attacks, except specialized weapons (hammer, mace)
- rework of the repair system?
	- remove "repair for profit" system, e.g. by removing the fact that price is calcualted by condition
	- Raise minimum sell price of condition gear to 50%? This would reduce the profit from tool repairs by half
- move death dealer over to powerful strikes group. its more fitting there and that group could use a sixth perk
	- however then the agile tree is a bit lacking
- change cover ally to debuff the targets melee skill and melee defense, to make it harder to use offensively
- Make Wiki Page specifically noting "Cheese" strategies from Vanilla that are patched out
	- T3 nacho swallowing bro
	- perma stunning enemies
	- listening for idle sounds to "scout" locations
- Make End Turn no longer waste all AP?
	- Make Vigilant explicitely spend all your remaining AP when ending turn
	- Make Command being able to target allies who ended their turns already (if that does not cause too many issues)
- Disable chain-routing (disable morale checks from allies losing morale, or maybe allow it one layer deep, but not two)
- what does this.Time.setVirtualTime(0); do? Can I manipulate daytime with this?
- Auto Focus the input boxes during campaign creation. Support Enter/Backspace to move forward and backwards during that screen. Both are a bit tricky because the js code is a huge block
- Display Reputation/Payment changes during payment negotiation
- selling quiver returns their ammo to the player pool?
- highlight destination locations/entities, while the player is moving towards them explicitely
- Make brothers dying in battle more punishing, mood wise (out of combat). To prevent you disposing unwanted brothers this way or discouraging using unwanted brothers as fodder
- Reduce enemies with Survival Instinct
- Raise fatigue cost of high tier two-handed weapons beyond 15 again
- Clean up Readme section "For Modder": add default values consitently; add new subsubsections "New Events", "General Decisions"

## Perks Review/Rework
- Relentless: misses dont build up fatigue on you while waiting
- switch leverage with long reach
- change Rising Star to only gain exp until lvl 12 and grant the two perks always at level 12
These Perks (top = higher prio) im still unhappy with and eventually want to adjust
- Feral Rage
- Trick Shooter
- Sanguinary
- Mauler
	- replace second effect with 15% more damage when hitting body parts that have no remaining armor
- Vanquisher
- Bone Breaker
	- Attacking a body part that has armor remaining, has 50% less injury threshold. Attacking a body part with no armor remaining, inflicts an additional injury of the same type and threshold, if the attack inflicts one
- Rush of Battle
- Battle Fervor
- Death Dealer
- FastAgileS Rework
	- Revert Footwork to Vanilla and move it to T1 of Agile
	- Move Pathfinder to T3 of Agile
	- Add Sprint to T5 of Fast (from T5 of Agile)
	- Move Combo to T5 of Agile (from T5 of Fast)
- Power Shot
- Take Aim Perk (previously Power Shot)
	- Whenever you wait or end your turn, gain a stacking +5% chance to hit. All bonus is lost, when you attack or move.
	- Unlock **Take Aim** skill, which does the same thing as the mastery thingy stuff

- split hyena/nachzehrer troops in combat/world map
- orc slayer / crusader events, make them cost 5k crowns each to hire those guys

## Test:
- Does reload disorientation apply to the currently fired bolt if used too quick?

## AI
- make it so enemies are less likely to remove the net if it doesnt affect them (e.g. Orcs)
- Change AI Rotation to not/rarely rotate your brothers into battle?
- Make enemy archers prefer to use wait instead of blindly advancing, if their frontline hasn't advanced yet
	- Make make enemy archers prefer wait during the first turn in general, if they have no target?
- Make root skills much more likely to target someone with Unstoppable stacks (because they cancel unstoppable)
- Lower the urge for nachzehrers to kill themselves to ZOC just to seek out a corpse
- Make someone with **Crowded** less likely to be targeted by displacement skills (knock back/repel). That would only help those

## Fix:
- Fix Vig assault over in Reforged (use same logic as Opportunist)
- dog ai too fast, not realizing reanimating zombies and dying to ZOC hits
- remove double ammo from towns, spawned by fletcher (as fletcher sells its own ammo)
- Vanilly Pasting pasting way too many times. I could use a variable thats turned on on pressing and turned off on releasing the paste combination
- Improve ::Const.World.Common.generateName random name feature to also affect generateName from random enemy types (hookTree of actor.nut?)
- Attached locations at game start never clear their name if you turn off the option
- Make Rotate no longer cause resolve checks
- Look into throwing weapons not producing miss-projectiles correctly when missing, sometimes
	- Need more evidence
- Fix orcs sometimes using charge, even though they decided to give uple"
- Alps that teleport during first turn before revealing, might be shown as unknown, even though you can see them because they arrived on visible tiles

## For modder:
- Framework for tracking round number of a skill for an entity https://github.com/MSUTeam/MSU/issues/351

## Rework Training Hall
- Once per battle if you start your turn fleeing and not adjacent to an enemy, recover your morale to steady

## Debug:
This will unbrick your end-of-combat screen, if it doesnt show
::Tactical.State.m.TacticalCombatResultScreen.show();

# Current Todo:

- Display Renown gained from Contracts in the reward screen of contracts alongside the money
- Reload disorientation AI
- add small delay after new round, before reanimation begines (100ms) so that new-round effects are more visible
- Give Bog Unhold split shield
- Make Anticipation influence attacker with stuns to be more likely to attack
